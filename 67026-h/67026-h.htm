<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Mondragola of Machiavelli, which reflects
Italian morals at the time of the Renaissance, is
well known. Lafontaine has later made use of
this motif in one of his humorous stories. In the
fourth chapter Liguro arrays in battle order an officer, a
valet and a doctor, for a humorous love expedition. Liguro
says: “In the right corner we shall place Callimaque; I shall
place myself in the extreme left corner, and the doctor in the
middle. He will be called St. Cuckold.”</p>

<p>An interlocutor: “Who is this Saint?”</p>

<p>“The greatest Saint of France.”</p>

<p>This question and the answer given are delicious. Brantôme
might have made this witticism even in his time. Perhaps
he merely did not write it down, for after all he could
not make too extensive use of his favorite play with the
word “cocu.”</p>

<p>“The cuckold, the greatest Saint of France”; this might
have been the motto of the “Dames Galantes.” Philarete
Chasles would have denied this, of course. He always maintained
that Gaul was pure and chaste, and that if France was
full of vice, it had merely been infected by neighboring
peoples. But this worthy academician was well informed
merely regarding Italian influence. He was extremely unaware
of the existence of the cuckold in the sixteenth century.
He even asserts in the strongest terms (in his preface to the
edition of 1834) that all of this had not been so serious; the
courtiers had merely desired to be immoral in an elegant
fashion. He even calls Brantôme “un fanfaron de licence,”
a braggart of vice. Indeed he would feel unhappy if he
could not reassure us: “Quand il se plonge dans les impuretes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
c’est, croyez-moi, pure fanfaronnade de vice.” Who
would not smile at this worthy academician who has remained
so unfamiliar with the history of his kings? His “believe
me” sounds very well. But the best is yet to come. The
book of the “Dames Galantes” was by no means to be considered
merely a frivolous collection of scandalous anecdotes,
but a “curious historical document.”</p>

<p>There will probably always be a difference of opinion regarding
Brantôme’s position in the history of civilization.
It will probably be impossible to change the judgments of
the ordinary superficial reader. But we do not wish to dispose
of Brantôme as simply as that. It is very easy for a
Puritan to condemn him. But we must seek to form a fairer
judgment. Now in order to overcome this difficulty, it is, of
course, very tempting simply to proclaim his importance for
the history of civilization and to put him on the market as
such. This would not be wrong, but this method has been
used altogether too freely, both properly and improperly.
Besides, Brantôme is too good to be labelled in this manner.
He does not need it either, he is of sufficient historical importance
even without its being pointed out. The question now
arises: From what point of view are we then to comprehend
Brantôme? We could answer, from the time in which he
lived. But that, speaking in such general terms, is a commonplace.
It is not quite correct either. For in spite of the
opinions of the educated we must clearly distinguish between
Brantôme as an author and Brantôme as a man—and we shall
hear more of this bold anarchistic personality, who almost
throws his chamberlain’s key back at the king. This is another
striking case where the author must by no means be
identified with his book. These events might have passed
through another person’s mind; they would have remained
the same nevertheless. For Brantôme did not originate them,
he merely chronicled them. Now it usually happens that
things are attributed to an author of which he is entirely
innocent (does not Society make an author pay for his confessions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
in book-form?). He is even charged with a crime
when he merely reports such events. The responsibility which
Brantôme must bear for his writings is greatly to be limited.
And if our educated old maids simply refuse to be reconciled
with his share we need merely tell them that this share is
completely neutralized by his own personal life.</p>

<p>Brantôme undoubtedly considered himself an historian.
That was a pardonable error. There is a great difference of
opinion regarding the historical value of his reports, the
most general opinion being that Brantôme’s accuracy is in no
way to be relied upon, and that he was more a chronicler and
a writer of memoirs. To be sure, Brantôme cannot prove the
historical accuracy of every statement he makes. Who would
be able to give an exact account of this kaleidoscope of details?
But the significance, the symbolic value is there.</p>

<p>In order to substantiate this sharp distinction between the
book of Fair and Gallant Ladies and the supposed character
of its author, I must be permitted to describe France of the
sixteenth century. Various essayists have said that this
period had been quite tame and pure in morals, that Brantôme
had merely invented and exaggerated these stories. But when
they began to cite examples, it became evident that their
opinion was like a snake biting its own tail. Their examples
proved the very opposite of their views.</p>

<p>Brantôme’s book could only have been written at the time
of the last of the Valois. These dissolute kings furnished
material for his book. Very few of these exploits can be
charged to his own account, and even these he relates in an
impersonal manner. Most of them he either witnessed or they
were related to him, largely by the kings themselves. No
matter in what connection one may read the history of the second
half of the sixteenth century, the dissolute, licentious and
immoral Valois are always mentioned. The kings corrupted
this period to such an extent that Brantôme would have had
to be a Heliogabalus in order to make his own contributions
felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span></p>

<p>At the beginning of this period we meet with the influence
of the Italian Renaissance. Through the crusades of Charles
VIII., France came into close contact with it. These kings
conducted long wars for the possession of Milan, Genoa, Siena
and Naples. A dream of the South induced the French to
cross the Alps, and every campaign was followed by a new
flood of Italian culture. If at the beginning of the sixteenth
century France was not yet the Capital of grand manners,
it approached this condition with giant strides during the
reign of Francis I. For now there was added an invasion
of Spanish culture. Next to Rome, Madrid had the greatest
influence upon Paris. Francis I., this chivalrous king (1515–1547),
introduced a flourishing court life. He induced
Italian artists such as Leonardo and Cellini to come to Blois
and try to introduce the grand Spanish manners into his own
court. For a time France still seemed to be an imitation of
Italy, but a poor one. With the preponderance of the Spanish
influence the Etiquette of Society approached its perfection.</p>

<p>Francis I. therefore brought knighthood into flower. He
considered a nobleman the foremost representative of the
people and prized chivalry more than anything else. The
court surrendered itself to a life of gaiety and frivolity; even
at this period the keeping of mistresses became almost an
official institution. “I have heard of the king’s wish,” Brantôme
relates, “that the noblemen of his court should not be
without a lady of their heart and if they did not do as he
wished he considered them simpletons without taste. But he
frequently asked the others the name of their mistresses and
promised to help and to speak for them. Such was his kindness
and intimacy.” Francis I. is responsible for this saying:
“A court without women is like a year without a spring, like
a spring without roses.” To be sure, there was also another
side to this court life. There were serious financial troubles,
corruption in administration and sale of offices. The Italian
architects who constructed the magnificent buildings of Saint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
Germain, Chantilly, Chambord and Chenonceaux were by no
means inexpensive. Great interest was also taken in literary
things. A more refined French was developed at this period.
In Blois a library, Chambre de Librarye, was established.
All of the Valois had great talent in composing poetic epistles,
songs and stories, not merely Marguerite of Navarre, the
sister of Francis I., who following the example of her brother
was a patroness of the arts. To be sure, mention is also made
of the “terrifying immorality” in Pau, even though this may
not have been so bad. Brantôme is already connected with
this court life in Pau. His grandmother, Louise of Daillon,
Seneschal of Poitiers, was one of the most intimate ladies-in-waiting
of the Queen of Navarre. His mother, Anne of
Bourdeille, is even introduced in several stories of the <i>Heptameron</i>.
She is called Ennasuite, and his father Francis of
Bourdeille appears as Simontaut. Life in the Louvre became
more and more lax. Francis I., this royal Don Juan,
is even said to have been a rival of his son, without our knowing,
however, whether this refers to Catherine of Medici or
to Diana of Poitiers. Another version of the story makes
Henri II. a rival of his father for the favor of Diana of
Poitiers. But the well known revenge of that deceived nobleman
which caused the death of Francis I. was entirely unnecessary.
It is said that the king had been intentionally infected.
He could not be healed and died of this disease. At any rate,
his body was completely poisoned by venereal ulcers, when
he died. This physical degeneration was a terrible heritage
which he left to his son, Henri II. (1547–1550).</p>

<p>The latter had in the meantime married Catherine of Medici.
Italian depravities now crossed the Alps in even greater numbers.
She was followed by a large number of astrologers,
dancers, singers, conjurors and musicians who were like a
plague of locusts. She thus accelerated the cultural process,
she steeped the court of Henri II. as well as that of his three
sons in the spirit of Italy and Spain. (The numerous citations
of Brantôme indicate the frequency and closeness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
relations at this time between France and Spain, the classical
country of chivalry.) But her greed for power was always
greater than her sensual desires. Though of imposing exterior,
she was not beautiful, rather robust, ardently devoted
to hunting, and masculine also in the quantity of food she
consumed. She talked extremely well and made use of her
literary skill in her diplomatic correspondence, which is estimated
at about 6,000 letters. She was not, however, spared
the great humiliation of sharing the bed and board of her
royal husband with Madame de Valentinois, Diana of Poitiers,
the mistress of Henri II. In this difficult position with an
ignorant and narrow-minded husband who was moreover
completely dominated by his favorites, she maintained a very
wise attitude. Catherine of Medici was, of course, an intriguing
woman who later tried to carry out her most secret purposes
in the midst of her own celebrations.</p>

<p>Henri II. had four sons and a daughter, who were born
to him by Catherine of Medici after ten years of sterility.
In them the tragic fate of the last of the Valois was fulfilled.
One after the other mounts the throne which is devoid of
any happiness. The last of them is consumed when he has
barely reached it. The blood of the Valois would have died
out completely but for its continuation in the Bourbons
through Marguerite, the last of the Valois, who with her bewitching
beauty infatuated men and as the first wife of Henri
IV. filled the world with the reports of her scandalous life.
There is tragedy in the fact that the book of Fair and Gallant
Ladies was dedicated to Alençon, the last and youngest of
the Valois. Of these four sons each was more depraved than
the other; they furnished the material for Brantôme’s story.
The book of Fair and Gallant Ladies, therefore, also seals
the end of the race.</p>

<p>The line began with Francis II. He mounted the throne
when he was a boy of sixteen. He was as weak mentally as
he was physically. He died in 1560, less than a year later,
“as a result of an ulcer in the head.” Then Catherine of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
Medici was Regent for ten years. In 1571 the next son,
Charles, was old enough to mount the throne. He was twenty-two
years old, tall and thin, weak on his legs, with a stooping
position and sickly pale complexion. Thus he was painted
by François Clouet, called Janet, a famous painting which
is now in possession of the Duke of Aumale. While a young
prince, he received the very best education. His teachers
were Amyot and Henri Estienne, with whom he read Plotin,
Plato, Virgil, Cicero, Tacitus, Polybius and Machiavelli.
Amyot’s translation of Plutarch’s Lives delighted the entire
court. “The princesses of the House of France,” Brantôme
relates, “together with their ladies-in-waiting and maids-of-honor,
took the greatest pleasure in the sayings of the Greeks
and Romans which have been preserved by sweet Plutarch.”
Thus literature came into its own even in this court life. But
they did not merely do homage to the old classical literature,
all of them were also versed in the art of the sonnet, and
were able to rhyme graceful love songs as well as Ronsard.
Charles IX. himself wrote poetry and translated the Odes of
Horace into French. His effeminate nature, at one moment
given to humiliating excesses and in the next consumed by
pangs of conscience, was fond of graceful and frivolous poetry.
But there was also some good in this movement. Whereas the
French language had been officially designated in 1539 as the
Language of Law, to be used also in lectures, Charles IX.
now gave his consent in 1570 for the founding of a Society
to develop and purify the language. But even in this respect
the honest de Thou denounced “this depraved age” and spoke
of “the poisoning of women by immoral songs.” This worthy
man himself wrote Latin, of course. A time of disorder was
now approaching, the revolts of the Huguenots were sweeping
through France. But these very disorders and dangers
encouraged a certain bold carelessness and recklessness.
Murder was slinking through the streets. It was the year of
St. Bartholomew’s Eve. The Duke of Anjou himself relates
that he feared to be stabbed by his own brother king, Charles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
IX., and later when he himself mounted the throne his brother
Alençon was in conspiracy against him. The Mignons and
the Rodomonts, the coxcombs and braggarts, were increasing
at this depraved court. Soon it was able seriously to compete
with Madrid and Naples. Indeed the people down there now
began to look up to France as the centre of fashion. Brantôme
was the first to recognize this and he was glad of it.
Indeed he even encouraged it. Even at that time the Frenchman
wished to be superior to all other people.</p>

<p>The king was completely broken by the results of St.
Bartholomew’s Eve. His mind wandered back and forth.
He became gloomy and vehement, had terrible hallucinations,
and heard the spirits of the dead in the air. By superhuman
exertions he tried to drown his conscience and procure sleep.
He was constantly hunting, remaining in the saddle continuously
from twelve to fourteen hours and often three days
in succession. When he did not hunt he fenced or played ball
or stood for three to four hours at the blacksmith’s anvil
swinging an enormous hammer. Finally, consumption forced
him to stay in bed. But even now he passed his time by writing
about his favorite occupation, he was composing the <i>Livre
du Roy Charles</i>, a dissertation on natural history and the deer
hunt. When he reached the twenty-ninth chapter death overtook
him. This fragment deserves praise, it was well thought
out and not badly written.</p>

<p>It is always unpleasant to say of a king that he had more
talent to be an author than a king. It is unfortunate but true
that the Valois were a literary race. But France itself in
1577 was in a sorry state. Everywhere there were ruins of
destroyed villages and castles. There were enormous stretches
of uncultivated land and cattle-raising was greatly diminished.
There were many loafing vagabonds accustomed to war and
robbery who were a danger to the traveller and the farmer.
Every province, every city, almost every house was divided
against itself.</p>

<p>Francis of Alençon, the fourth of these brothers, who felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>
himself coming of age, the last of the Valois, had already
begun his agitation. Charles IX. despised him and suspected
his secret intrigues. His other brother, Henri, had to watch
his every step in order to feel secure.</p>

<p>Henri III. (1574–1589), formerly Henri of Anjou, was
barely twenty-five years old when his strength was exhausted.
But his greed of power which had already made him king of
the Polish throne was still undiminished. He was the most
elegant, the most graceful and the most tasteful of the Valois.
It was therefore only to be expected that he would introduce
new forms of stricter etiquette. D’Aubigne relates that he
was a good judge of the arts, and that he was “one of the
most eloquent men of his age.” He was always on the
search for poetry to gratify his erotic impulses. A life of
revelry and pleasure now began in the palace. Immorality
is the mildest reproach of his contemporary chroniclers. Although
well educated and a friend of the Sciences, of Poetry
and the Arts, as well as gifted by nature with a good mind, he
was nevertheless very frivolous, indifferent, physically and
mentally indolent. He almost despised hunting as much as
the conscientious discharge of government affairs. He greatly
preferred to be in the society of women, himself dressed in
a feminine fashion, with two or three rings in each ear. He
usually knew what was right and proper, but his desires, conveniences
and other secondary matters prevented him from
doing it. He discharged all the more serious and efficient
men and surrounded himself with insignificant coxcombs, the
so-called Mignons, with whom he dallied and adorned himself,
and to whom he surrendered the government of the state.
These conceited young men, who were without any redeeming
merit, simply led a gay life at the court. In his History of
France (I, 265), Ranke relates: “He surrounded himself
with young people of pleasing appearance who tried to outdo
him in cleanliness of dress and neatness of appearance. To
be a favorite, a Mignon, was not a question of momentary approval
but a kind of permanent position.” Assassinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
were daily occurrences. D’Aubigne severely criticized the
terrifying conditions in the court and public life in general.
A chronicler says: “At that time anything was permitted
except to say and do what was right and proper.” This frivolous,
scandalous court consumed enormous sums of money.
Such a miserable wretch as Henri III. required for his personal
pleasures an annual sum of 1,000,000 gold thalers,
which is equivalent to about $10,000,000 in present values,
and yet the entire state had to get along with 6,000,000
thalers. For this was all that could be squeezed out of the
country. Ranke says (page 269): “In a diary of this period,
the violent means of obtaining money and the squandering
of the same by the favorites are related side by side, and
it shows the disagreeable impression that these things made.”
Then there was also the contrast between his religious and
his worldly life. At one time he would steep his feelings in
orgies, then again he would parade them in processions. He
was entirely capable of suddenly changing the gayest raiment
for sackcloth and ashes. He would take off his jewel-covered
belt and put on another covered with skulls. And in order
that Satan might not be lacking, the criminal court (“chambre
ardente”) which was established at Blois had plenty of work
to do during his reign. It was also evident that he would
never have any children with his sickly wife.</p>

<p>This same Henry III. while still Duke of Orleans tried to
gain the favor of Brantôme, who was then twenty-four years
old, and when he entered upon his reign appointed him his
chamberlain. This appointment took place in 1574. At the
same time, however, Francis of Alençon sought his favor.
Subsequently Brantôme entered into very intimate relations
with him.</p>

<p>Alençon is described to us as being small though well built
but with coarse, crude features, with the temper and irritability
of a woman and even greater cowardliness, likewise unreliable,
ambitious and greedy. He was a very vain, frivolous person
without political or religious convictions. From his youth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span>
up he was weak and sickly. His brother Henri despised and
hated him and kept him a barely concealed prisoner as long
as he could. Then Alençon revolted, gathered armies, founded
a new Ultra-Royal party and moved on Paris. He even
wished at one time to have his mother removed from the
court, who was still carrying on her intrigues throughout the
entire kingdom. They were obliged to negotiate with him
and he succeeded in extorting an indemnity which was almost
equal to a royal authority. He received five duchies and four
earldoms and his court had the power of passing death sentences.
He had a guard and a corps of pages in expensive
liveries and conducted a brilliant court. We must try and
picture him as Ranke describes him, “small and stocky, of an
obstinate bearing, bushy black hair over his ugly pock-marked
face, which, however, was brightened by a fiery eye.”</p>

<p>The book of Fair and Gallant Ladies is dedicated to Alençon,
but he did not see it any more. Brantôme, however,
must have begun it while he was still living. Alençon died
in 1584 at the age of thirty-one.</p>

<p>Five years later Henri III. was stabbed by Jacques Clement.
Thus the race of Henri III., which was apparently so fruitful,
had withered in his sons. The remaining sister, who was
inferior according to the Salic Law, was also extremely immoral.</p>

<p>Her husband, Henry IV., entered a country that was completely
exhausted. The state debt at the time he entered
upon his reign clearly showed the spirit of the previous governments.
In 1560 the state debt was 43,000,000 livres.
At the end of the century it had risen to 300,000,000. The
Valois sold titles and dignities to the rich, squeezed them
besides and were finally capable of mortgaging anything
they could lay their hands upon. In 1595 Henri IV. remarked
in Blois that “the majority of the farms and almost all the
villages were uninhabited and empty.” This mounting of the
state debt clearly indicates the extent of the depravity of the
court. During the reign of Charles IX. and Henri III., that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</span>
is between 1570 and 1590, the dissoluteness reached its height
and this made it possible for Brantôme to collect such a
large number of stories and anecdotes. Catherine of Medici,
who outlived her race by a year and whose influence continued
during this entire period, does not seem to have been a
saint herself. But the last three of the Valois were the
worst, the most frivolous and lascivious of them all. It was
during their reign that the rule of mistresses was at its height
in the Louvre and the royal castles which furnished Brantôme
with his inexhaustible material. Such were the Valois.</p>

<p>This is the background of Brantôme’s life. We should
like to know more about him. He has written about many
generals and important women of his age, but there are only
fragments regarding himself.</p>

<p>The family Bourdeille is one of the most important in Perigord.
Like other old races they sought to trace their ancestors
back into the times of Gaul and Rome. Charlemagne is
said to have founded the Abbey Brantôme.</p>

<p>Brantôme’s father was the “first page of the royal litter.”
His son speaks of him as “un homme scabreaux, haut a la
main et mauvais garçon.” His mother, a born Châtaigneraie,
was lady-in-waiting of the Queen of Navarre. Pierre was
probably also born in Navarre, but nothing is known as to the
exact day of birth. Former biographers simply copied, one
from the other, that he had died in 1614 at the age of eighty-seven.
This would make 1528 the year of his birth. But now
it is well known that Brantôme spent the first years of his life
in Navarre. Queen Marguerite died in 1549 and Brantôme
later writes of his sojourn at her court: “Moy estant petit
garçon en sa court.” Various methods of calculation seem
to indicate that he was born in 1540.</p>

<p>After the death of the Queen of Navarre—this is also a
matter of record—Brantôme went to Paris to take up his
studies. From Paris, where he probably also was a companion
of the <i>enfants sanssouci</i>, he went to Poitiers to continue
them. There in 1555, while still “a young student,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[xix]</span>
he became acquainted with the beautiful Gotterelle, who is
said to have had illicit relations with the Huguenot students.
When he had completed his studies in 1556 he as the youngest
son had to enter the church. He also received his share of
the Abbey Brantôme from Henri II. as a reward for the heroisms
of his older brother. This young abbot was about sixteen
years old. His signature and his title in family documents
in this period are very amusing: “Révérend père en
Dieu abbè de Brantôme.” As an abbot he had no ecclesiastical
duties. He was his own pastor, could go to war, get married
and do as he pleased. But nevertheless, this ecclesiastical
position did not suit him, and so he raised 500 gold
thalers by selling wood from his forests with which he fitted
himself out and then went off to Italy at the age of eighteen:
“Portant L’coquebuse a meche et un beau fourniment de
Milan, monte sur une haquenee de cent ecus et menant toujours
six on sept gentils hommes, armes et montes de meme,
et bien en point sur bons courtands.”</p>

<p>He simply went off wherever there was war. In Piedmont
he was shot in the face by an arrow which almost deprived
him of his sight. There he was lying in Portofino in these
marvellously beautiful foothills along the Genoese coast, and
there he was strangely healed: “Une fort belle dame de la
ma jettait dans les yeux du lait de ses beaux et blancs
tetins” (<i>Vies des Capitaines français</i>, Ch. IV, 499). Then
he went to Naples with François de Guise. He himself describes
his reception by the Duke of Alcala. Here he also
became acquainted with Madame de Guast, die Marquise del
Vasto.</p>

<p>In 1560 he left Italy and took up the administration of his
estates which heretofore had been in the hands of his oldest
brother, Andre. He joined the court in Amboise, where Francis
II. was conducting tournaments. At the same time the
House of Guise took notice of him. In recollection of his
uncle, La Châtaigneraie, he was offered high protection at the
court of Lorraine. From this time on he was at the court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[xx]</span>
for over thirty years. At first he accompanied the Duke of
Guise to his castle. Then after the death of Francis II. he
accompanied his widow, Mary Stuart, to England in August,
1561, and heard her final farewell to France.</p>

<p>Although Brantôme could not say enough in praise of the
princes of Lorraine, the Guises, he did not go over to their
side. Once at a later period when he was deeply embittered
he allowed himself to be carried away by them. At the outbreak
of the civil wars, Brantôme, of course, sided with the
court. He also participated in the battle of Dreux. If there
happened to be no war in France he would fight somewhere
abroad. In 1564 he entered into closer relations with the
court of the Duke of Orleans (later Henri III.). He became
one of his noblemen and received 600 livres annually. (The
receipts are still in existence.) In the same year he also
took part in an expedition against the Berbers on the Coast
of Morocco. We find him in Lisbon and in Madrid, where he
was highly honored by the courts. When Sultan Soliman
attacked Malta, Brantôme also hurried thither. He returned
by way of Naples and again presented himself to the Marquise
de Guast. He thought that at last he had found his
fortune but he felt constrained to continue his journey. He
later denounces this episode in the most vehement terms.
“Toujours trottant, traversant et vagabondant le monde.”
He was on his way to a new war in Hungary, but when he
arrived in Venice he heard that it was not worth while. He
returned by way of Milan and Turin, where he gave the impression
of being greatly impoverished, but he was too proud
to accept the purse of the Duchess of Savoy.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Huguenots had forced the king to
make greater and greater concessions. Prince Condé and
Admiral Coligny had the upper hand. The Huguenots, who
heard that Brantôme had reasons to be displeased with the
king, tried to induce him to commit treason. But Brantôme
remained firm. He was given the title Captain (“Maître de
camp”) of two companies even though he only had one—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</span>
that is typical of the French. This company (enseigne) was
under his command in the Battle of St. Venis (1567). In the
following year, 1568, Charles IX. engaged him as a paid
chamberlain. After the Battle of Jarnac in the following
year he was seized by a fever, as a result of which he had
to spend almost a year on his estates in order to recover.</p>

<p>As soon as he was well again he wished to go off to war
somewhere. He complained that it had been impossible for
him to participate in the Battle of Lepanto. His friend,
Strozzi, was now getting ready an expedition to Peru, which
was to recompense him. But some misunderstanding caused
his separation from Strozzi shortly afterwards. The preparations
for this expedition had, however, kept him away from
St. Bartholomew’s Eve, even though later he cursed them
for personal reasons.</p>

<p>Brantôme was not religious. He cannot be considered a
good judge in affairs of the Huguenots, for he was more
than neutral in religious matters. He took an indifferent
attitude towards the League. For as a secular priest, he had
the very best reasons for being neither in favor of the League
nor of the Huguenots. He speaks with great respect of
Coligny. They frequently met and the admiral was always
friendly. Brantôme disapproved of the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew’s Eve and considered it entirely reprehensible
and purposeless. This good warrior would have greatly preferred
to have seen these restless spirits engaged in a foreign
war. He says of this bloody eve: “Mort malheurse lu puis—je
bien appeller pour toute la France.” To be sure, in the
following year he was present at the Siege of La Rochelle,
the White City.</p>

<p>He was at the court when Charles IX. died. He accompanied
the corpse from Notre Dame to St. Denis and then
entered the services of Henri III., who finally bestowed some
favors upon the brothers Bourdeille and gave them the
Bishopric of Perigneux.</p>

<p>Then this restless soul was driven to approach Alençon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</span>
the youngest of the Valois. Bussy d’Amboise, the foremost
nobleman of Alençon, was his friend. Alençon overwhelmed
him with kindness and Brantôme had to beg the angry king’s
pardon for his defection.</p>

<p>But now an event occurred which almost drove Brantôme
into open rebellion. In 1582 his oldest brother died. The
Abbey had belonged to both of them, but his brother had appointed
his own heir and the king was helpless against this.
Brantôme became very angry because he was not the heir. “Je
ne suis qu’un ver de terre,” he writes. He now desired that
the king should at least give his share of the Abbey to his
nephew, but he was unsuccessful in this as well. Aubeterre
became Seneschal and Governor of Perigord. This fault-finder
could not control his anger: “Un matin, second jour
de premier de l’an ... je luy en fis ma plainte; il m’en fit
des excuses, bien qu’il fust mon roy. Je ne luy respondis
autre chose sinon: Eh bien, Sire, vous ne m’avez donne se
coup grand subject de vous faire jainais service comme j’ay
faict.” And so he ran off “fort despit.” As he left the
Louvre he noticed that the golden chamberlain’s key was still
hanging on his belt; he tore it off and threw it into the Seine,
so great was his anger.</p>

<p>(When Aubeterre died in 1593 these posts were returned
to the family Bourdeille.)</p>

<p>(Other reasons which angered Brantôme were less serious.
Thus he could not bear Montaigne because the latter was of
more recent nobility. He himself has shown that a man of
the sword could very well take up the pen to pass the time.
But he could not understand that the opposite might happen,
and a sword given to a man of the pen. He was appointed a
knight in the Order of St. Michael. But this did not satisfy
his ambition very much when he looked around and saw that
he had to share this distinction with many other men. He
wished to have it limited to the nobility of the sword. Now
his neighbor, Michel de Montaigne, received the same order.
Brantôme writes regarding this: “We have seen councillors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</span>
leave the courts of justice, put down their robe and their four-cornered
hat and take up a sword. Immediately the king
bestowed the distinction upon them without their ever having
gone to war. This has happened to Monsieur de Montaigne,
who would have done better to remain at his trade and continue
to write his essays rather than exchange his pen for a
sword which was not nearly so becoming.”)</p>

<p>Henri II. pardoned him his unmannerly behavior, but
the king’s rooms were closed to him. Then the Duke of Alençon
wished to gain his allegiance and appointed him chamberlain,
thereby rewarding him for the intimate relationship
which had existed between them ever since 1579. The duke
was the leader of the dissatisfied and so this fault-finder
was quite welcome to him. The book of Fair and Gallant
Ladies is the direct result of the conversations at the Court
of Alençon, for we hear that Brantôme soon wrote a few discourses
which he dedicated to the prince. Brantôme sold himself
to Alençon, which is almost to be taken literally. Then
Alençon died. Brantôme’s hopes were now completely
crushed.</p>

<p>What was he to do now? He was angry at the king. His
boundless anger almost blinded him. Then the Guises approached
him and tried to induce him to swear allegiance to
the enemies of the Valois. He was quite ready to do this and
was at the point of committing high treason, for the King of
Spain was behind the Guises, to whom he swore allegiance.
But the outbreak of the war of the Huguenots, which resulted
in a temporary depreciation of all estates, prevented him
from carrying out his plans immediately. He could not sell
anything, and without money life in Spain was impossible.
But this new state of affairs gave him new energy and new
life. He walked about with “sprightly vigor.” He later
described his feelings in the <i>Capitaines français</i> (Ch. IV,
108): “Possible que, si je fusse venu an bout de vies attantes
et propositions, J’eusse faut plus de mal a ma patrie que
jamais n’a faict renegat d’Alger a’la sienne, dont J’en fusse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</span>
este mandict a perpetuite, possible de Dieu et des hommes.”</p>

<p>Then a horse that he was about to mount, shied, rose up and
fell, rolling over him, so that all his ribs were broken. He
was confined to his bed for almost four years; crippled and
lame, without being able to move because of pain.</p>

<p>When he was able to rise again the new order of things
was in full progress, and when the iron hand of Henri IV.,
this cunning Navarrese and secret Huguenot, swept over
France, the old court life also disappeared. Brantôme was
sickly and when the old Queen-mother Medici also died
(1590) he buried himself completely in his abbey and took no
interest henceforth in the events of his time.</p>

<p>“Chaffoureur du papier”—this might be the motto of his
further life. Alas, writing was also such a resignation for
Brantôme, otherwise he would not have heaped such abuse
upon it. But we must not imagine that his literary talent
only developed after his unfortunate fall. Naturally he
made quite different and more extensive use of it under these
conditions than he otherwise would have done. Stirring up
his old memories became more and more a means of mastering
the sterile life of that period. Literature is a product of
impoverished life. It is the opium intoxication of memory,
the conjuring up of bygone events. The death-shadowed
eyes of Alençon had seen the first fragments of the book of
Fair and Gallant Ladies. The <i>Rondomontades Espagnoles</i>
must have been finished in 1590, for he offered them to the
Queen of Navarre in the Castle of Usson in Auvergne. But
beginning in 1590 there was a conscious exchange of the sword
for the pen. He knew himself well. On his bed of pain the
recollections of his varied life, his sufferings and the complaints
of his thwarted ambitions became a longed-for distraction.
He died July 15, 1614, and was buried in the
Chapel of Richemond.</p>

<p>His manuscripts had a strange fate. They were the principal
care of his last will and testament. This in itself is a
monument to his pride. “J’ai bien de l’ambition,” he writes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</span>
“je la veux encore monstrer apres ma mort.” He had decided
elements of greatness. The books in his library were
to remain together, “set up in the castle and not to be scattered
hither and thither or loaned to anyone.” He wished to
have the library preserved “in eternal commemoration of himself.”
He was particularly interested in having his works
published. He pretended to be a knight, and a nobleman, and
yet he prized most highly these six volumes beautifully bound
in blue, green and black velvet. His books, furthermore, were
not to be published with a pseudonym, but his own name was
to be openly printed on the title-page. He does not wish
to be deprived of his labors and his fame. He gave the strictest
instructions to his heirs, but he was constantly forced to
make additions to the will, because his executors died. He
outlived too many of them and had made his will too early.
The instructions regarding the printing of his books are very
amusing: “Pour les faire imprimer mieux a ma fantaisie,
... y’ordonne et veux, que l’on prenne sur ma lotate heredite
l’argent qu ’en pouvra valoir la dite impression, et qui ne se
pouvra certes monter a beaucoup, cur j’ay veu force imprimeurs
... que s’ils out mis une foys la veue, en donneront
plusoost pour les imprimer qu’ils n’en voudraient recepvoir;
car ils en impriment plusierus gratis que no valent pas les
mieux. Je m’en puys bien vanter, mesmes que je les ay
monstrez au moins en partie, a aueuns qui les ont voulu
imprimer sans rien.... Mais je n’ay voulu qu ils fussent
imprimez durant mon vivant. Surtout, je veux que la dicte
impression en soit en belle et gross lettre, et grand colume,
pour mieux paroistre....” The typographical directions
are quite modern. The execution of the will finally came into
the hands of his niece, the Countess of Duretal, but on account
of the offence that these books might give, she hesitated to
carry out the last will of her uncle. Then his later heirs
refused to have the books published, and locked the manuscripts
in the library. In the course of time, however, copies
came into circulation, more and more copies were made, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</span>
one of them found its way into the office of a printer. A fragment
was smuggled into the memoirs of Castelnau and was
printed with them in 1659. A better edition was now not far
off. In 1665 and 1666 the first edition was published in
Leyden by Jean Sambix. It comprised nine volumes in
Elzevir. This very incomplete and unreliable edition was
printed from a copy. Speculating printers now made a number
of reprints. A large number of manuscripts were now
in circulation which were named according to the copyists.
In the 17th and 18th centuries these books were invariably
printed from copies. The edition of 1822, <i>Oeuvres completes
du seigneur de Brantôme</i> (Paris: Foucault), was the first
to go back to the original manuscripts in possession of the
family Bourdeille. Monmergue edited it. The manuscript
of the book of Fair and Gallant Ladies was in the possession
of the Baroness James Rothschild as late as 1903. After
her death in the beginning of 1904, it came into possession
of the National Library in Paris, which now has all of Brantôme’s
manuscripts, and also plans to publish a critical revised
edition of his collected works.</p>

<p>The two books, <i>Vies des Dames illustres</i> and <i>Vies des
Dames galantes</i>, were originally called by Brantôme Premier
and Second Livre des Dames. The new titles were invented
by publishers speculating on the taste of the times, which from
1660 to 1670 greatly preferred the words illustre and galante.
The best subsequent edition of the Fair and Gallant Ladies is
that printed by Abel Ledoux in Paris, 1834, which was edited
by Philarete Chasles, who also supplied an introduction and
notes. On the other hand, the critical edition of his collected
works in 1822 still contains the best information regarding
Brantôme himself, and the remarks by the editor Monmergue
are very excellent and far superior to the opinions which
Philarete Chasles expresses, poetic as they may be. The
crayon-drawings and copper-cuts of Famous and Gallant
Ladies of the sixteenth century contained in Bouchot’s book,
<i>Les femmes de Brantôme</i>, are very good; Bouchot’s text,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</span>
however, is merely a re-hash of Brantôme himself. Neither
must one over-estimate his reflections regarding the author of
the Fair and Gallant Ladies.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between the two Livres des
Dames. What is an advantage in the one is a disadvantage in
the other. Undoubtedly Brantôme’s genius is best expressed
in the <i>Dames Galantes</i>. In this book the large number of
symbolical anecdotes is the best method of narration. In the
other they are more or less unimportant. Of course, Brantôme
could not escape the questionable historical methods of
that period, but shares these faults with all of his contemporaries.
Besides, he was too good an author to be an excellent
historian. The devil take the historical connection, as long
as the story is a good one.</p>

<p>The courtier Brantôme sees all of history from the perspective
of boudoir-wit. Therefore his portraits of famous
ladies of his age are mere mosaics of haphazard observations
and opinions. He is a naïve story-teller and therefore his
ideas are seldom coherent. The value of his biographical
portraits consists in the fact that they are influenced by his
manner of writing, that they are the result of scandal and
gossip which he heard in the Louvre, or of conversations in
the saddle or in the trenches. He always preserves a respectful
attitude and restrains himself from spicing things too
freely. He did not allow himself to become a purveyor of
malicious gossip, he took great care not to offend his high
connections by unbridled speech, but his book lost interest on
that account.</p>

<p>If we wish to do justice to Brantôme as the author of Fair
and Gallant Ladies, we must try and picture his position in
his age and in his society. It is not to be understood that
he suddenly invented all of these stories during his long illness.
Let us try and follow the origin of these memoirs. At
that time the most primitive conceptions of literary work in
general prevailed. The actual writing down of the stories
was the least. An author laboriously working out his stories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</span>
was ridiculous. The idea and the actual creative work came
long before the moment when the author sat down to write.
None of Brantôme’s stories originated in his abbey, but in
Madrid, in Naples, in Malta before La Rochelle, in the Louvre,
in Blois and in Alençon. Writing down a story was a reproduction
of what had already been created, of what had been
formed and reformed in frequent retelling and polished to
perfection. The culture of the court was of great aid to
him in his style, but his own style was nevertheless far
superior.</p>

<p>For decades Brantôme was a nobleman of his royal masters.
He was constantly present at the court and participated in
all of the major and minor events of its daily life, in quarrels
and celebrations. He was a courtier. He was entirely at
home in the halls and chambers of the Louvre, but even though
he stopped to chat with the idle courtiers in the halls of the
Louvre he never lowered himself to their level. He could be
extremely boisterous, yet inwardly he was reserved and observant.
He was the very opposite of the noisy, impetuous Bussy-Rabutin.
His intelligence and his wisdom made him a source
of danger among the chamberlains. His was a dual nature,
he was at the same time cynical and religious, disrespectful
and enthusiastic, refined and brutal, at the same time abbot,
warrior and courtier. Like Bernhard Palissy he ridiculed the
astrologers, yet he was subject to the superstitions of his age.
His temperament showed that his cradle had not been far from
the banks of the Garonne, near the Gascogne. There was
combined with his bold, optimistic, adventurous and restless
spirit, with his chivalrous ideas and prejudices, a boundless
vanity. A contemporary said of him: “He was as boastful
as Cellini.” Indeed he believed himself far superior to his
class, he not only boasted of himself and his family, but also
of his most insignificant deeds. He was irreconcilable in
hate, and even admonished his heirs to revenge him. His
royal masters he treated with respect tempered by irony. As
a contemporary of Rabelais, Marot and Ronsard, he was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</span>
excellent speaker. If Rabelais had a Gallic mind then Brantôme’s
was French. His cheerful and lively conversation
was pleasing to all. He had a reputation of being a brilliant
man. But he was also known as a discreet person. Alençon,
who was a splendid story-teller himself and liked to hear
love stories more than anything else, preferred conversation
with him to anyone. His naïveté and originality made friends
for him everywhere. He had a brave and noble nature and
was proud of being a Frenchman, he was the personified
<i>gentilhomme français</i>.</p>

<p>And thus his book originated. He must have taken up his
pen quite spontaneously one day. Now from the great variety
of his own experiences at court and in war, he poured forth
a remarkable wealth of peculiar and interesting features
which his memory had preserved. It is a book of the love-life
during the reign of the Valois. These stories were not
invented, but they were anecdotes and reports taken from
real life. He was able to evade the danger of boredom.
There is style even in his most impudent indiscretions. He
only stopped at mere obscenities. On the other hand, he
never hesitated to be cynical. As this age was fond of strong
expressions, a puritanical language was out of the question.
Not until the reign of Louis XIV. did the language become
more polite. Neither was Brantôme a Puritan, how could he
have been? But he had character. He took pleasure in
everything which was a manifestation of human energy. He
loved passion and the power to do good or evil. (To be sure
he also had some splendid things to say against immoderacy
and vehemence of passions. So he was a fit companion of the
Medici and the Valois.)</p>

<p>There is not much composition in his books. His attention
wandered from one story to the other. Boccaccio, the foremost
story-teller of this period, is more logical. An academical
critic says of Brantôme: “He reports without choice what
is good and bad, what is noble and abominable, the good not
without warmth, but the bad with indestructible cheerfulness.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</span>
There is neither order nor method in his writing. He
passes on abruptly, without motif, without transition. A
courtier, unfamiliar with the rules of the school, he himself
confesses (in the <i>Rodomontades Espagnoles</i>): “Son pen
de profession du scavoir et de l’art de bien dire, et remet aux
meux disans la belle disposition de paroles eloquentes.” Because
of the variety his stories have unusual charm. In these
numerous anecdotes the graceful indecencies of the ladies-in-waiting
at the court of the Valois are described as if they had
happened openly. His reports of the illicit relations are
rendered in a charming style. Even though his sketches and
pictures are modelled entirely on the life at the courts, nevertheless
he adds two personal elements: an amusing smile and
a remarkable literary talent. The following may even have
been the case. In the beginning Brantôme may have taken
an entirely neutral attitude towards the material at hand,
but took no greater personal interest in them than he would,
say, in memoirs. But when we can tell a story well, then we
also take pleasure in our ability. We permeate the story with
our own enjoyment, and in a flash it turns out to be pleasure
in the thing itself. The light of our soul glows upon them
and then the things themselves look like gold. Brantôme
rarely breaks through his reserve. He usually keeps his own
opinions regarding these grand ladies and gentlemen in the
background, he leaves it to the competent “grands discoureurs”
to judge these things. To be sure, if one wished to get information
regarding the court of Henri II. and Catherine of
Medici, one ought not exactly to read Brantôme, who creates
the impression as if the court were a model of a moral institution.
“Sa compaignie et sa court estait un vray paradis du
monde et escole de toute honnestate, de virtu, l’ornement de la
France,” he once says somewhere in the <i>Dames illustres</i> (page
64). On the other hand, L’Etorle in May, 1577, gives us a
report of a banquet given by the Queen-mother in Chenonceaux:
“Les femmes les plus belles et honnestes de la cour,
estant a moitie nues et ayant, les cheveux epars comme espousees,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</span>
fuient employees a faire le service.” Other contemporaries
likewise report a great deal of the immorality prevailing
at the court. Thus we have curious reports regarding
the pregnancy of Limeuil, who had her birth-throes in the
queen’s wardrobe in Lyon (1564), the father being the Prince
of Conde. Likewise, Johanna d’Albret warns her son, later
Henri IV., against the corruption of the court. When she
later visited him in Paris she was horrified at the immorality
at the court of her daughter-in-law, later Queen Margot, who
lived in the “most depraved and dissolute society.” (Brantôme
pretended that he was a relative of hers, and pronounced
a panegyric upon her in his Rodomontades which was
answered in her memoirs dedicated to him.) He did not feel
it his mission to be a Savonarola. To his great regret this
“culture” came home to him in his own family. He had more
and more cause to be dissatisfied with his youngest sister,
Madeleine. The wicked life of this lady-in-waiting filled
him with fury. He paid her her share and drove her from
the house.</p>

<p>Certain Puritans among the historians find fault with Brantôme
for having uncovered the “abominations” at the courts
of the Valois. His vanity may have led him to make many
modifications in the events, but most of these are probably
due to his desire to be entertaining. In his dedication to the
<i>Rodomontades Espagnoles</i> he addresses Queen Margot as
follows: “Bien vous dirai-je, que ce que j’escrits est plein
de verite; de ce que j’ay veu, je l’asseure, di ce que j’ay seen
et appris d’autray, si on m’a trompe je n’en puis mais si tiens-je
pourtant beaucoup de choses de personnages et de livres
tres-veritables et dignes de foy.” Nevertheless, his method
was very primitive. In his descriptions of personalities, he
had a thread on which he could string up his recollections, so
that there was at least some consistency. In the book of
Fair and Gallant Ladies the individual fact is of less importance
and has more of symbolic value. They are pictures of
the time composed of a confusing multitude of anecdotes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</span>
Perhaps the subject-matter required this bizarre method.
The <i>Heptameron</i> of Marguerite of Navarre was altogether too
precise. Brantôme was a man of the sword and a courtier,
but a courtier who occasionally liked to put his hand on his
sword in between his witticisms. In this state of mind, he
was an excellent story-teller, and his anecdotes and stories
therefore also have the actuality and the vigorous composition
of naïvely related stories.</p>

<p>The book of Fair and Gallant Ladies still contains much of
historical value. Almost all the old noble races are mentioned;
there is information regarding Navarre, Parma, Florence,
Rome and Toulouse. The Huguenots likewise appear, and St.
Bartholomew’s Eve (1572), which was far back, still sheds
its gloom over these pages. The trenches before La Rochelle
play an important part; Brantôme always fought against the
Huguenots. Perhaps this was the reason why he was no
longer in favor with the Bourbon Henri IV. However, one
cannot charge him with animosity. Perhaps the frank and
open methods of reforming had affected him. Without taking
interest in religious quarrels, he probably also hated the
monks and priests. Thus one would be inclined to say to the
Puritans who condemn Brantôme: If one may speak of
guilt and responsibility, then it is his age which must bear
them. Brantôme merely chronicled the morals of his times.
The material was furnished to him, he merely wrote it down.
He is no more responsible for his book, than an editor of a
newspaper for the report of a raid or a bomb attack. Ranke
once said regarding the times of Henri II.: “If one wishes
to know the thoughts and opinions of France at that period,
one must read Rabelais” (History of France, Ch. I, 133).
Whoever wishes to become familiar with the age of Charles
IX. and Henri III. must read Brantôme.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> hath ever been the case that fair and honourable
ladies have loved brave and valiant
men, albeit by natural bent they be cowardly
and timid creatures. But such a virtue doth
valour possess with them, as that they do grow altogether
enamoured thereof. What else is this but to constrain
their exact opposite to love them, and this spite of their
own natural complexion? And for an instance of this
truth, Venus, which in ancient days was the goddess of
Beauty, and of all gentle and courteous bearing, being
fain, there in the skies and at the Court of Jupiter, to
choose her some fair and handsome lover and so make
cuckold her worthy husband Vulcan, did set her choice
on never a one of the pretty young gallants, those dapper,
curled darlings, whereof were so many to hand, but
did select and fall deep in love with the god Mars, god
of armies and warlike prowess,—and this albeit he was
all foul and a-sweat with the wars he had but just come
from, and all besmirched with dust and as filthy as might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
be, more smacking of the soldier in the field than the gallant
at Court. Nay! worse still, very oft mayhap all
bloody, as returning from battle, he would so lie with her,
without any sort of cleansing of himself or scenting of
his person.</p>

<p>Again, the fair and high-born Penthesilea, Queen of the
Amazons, having learned of fame concerning the valour
and prowess of the doughty Hector, and his wondrous
feats of arms which he did before Troy against the
Greeks, did at the mere report of all this grow so fondly
enamoured of the hero, that being fain to have so valiant
a knight for father of her children, her daughters to wit
which should succeed to her kingdom, she did hie her
forth to seek him at Troy. There beholding him, and
contemplating and admiring his puissance, she did all ever
she could to find favour with him, not less by the brave
deeds of war she wrought than by her beauty, the which
was exceeding rare. And never did Hector make sally
upon his foes but she would be at his side, and was always
as well to the front as Hector himself in the mêlée, wherever
the fight was hottest. In such wise that ’tis said
she did several times accomplish such deeds of daring and
so stir the Trojan’s wonder as that he would stop short
as if astonished in the midst of the fiercest combats, and
so withdraw somewhat on one side, the better to see and
admire this most valiant Queen doing such gallant deeds.</p>

<p>Thereafter, we leave the world to suppose what was
the issue of their love, and if they did put the same in
practise; and truly the result could not long be doubtful.
But any way, their pleasure was to be of no great duration
for the Queen, the better to delight her lover, did
so constantly rush forth to confront all hazards, that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
was slain at last in one of the fiercest and fellest encounters.
Others however say she did never see Hector
at all, but that he was dead before her arrival. So coming
on the scene and learning his death, she did thereupon
fall into so great grief and such sadness to have lost
the goodly sight she had so fondly desired and had come
from so far a land to seek, that she did start forth to meet
a voluntary death in the bloodiest battles of the war;
and so she died, having no further cause to live, now she
had failed of beholding the gallant being she had chosen
as best of all and had loved the
<span class="no-wrap">most.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The like was done by Thalestris, another Queen of the
Amazons, who did traverse a great country and cover I
know not how many leagues for to visit Alexander the
Great, and asking it of him as a favour, or as but a fair
exchange of courtesy, did lie with him in order that she
might have issue by him of so noble and generous a blood,
having heard him so high rated of all men. This boon
did Alexander very gladly grant her; and verily he must
needs have been sore spoiled and sick of women if he had
done otherwise, for the said Queen was as beautiful as she
was valiant. Quintus Curtius, Orosius and Justin do affirm
moreover that she did thus visit Alexander with
three hundred ladies in her suite, all bearing arms,
and all so fair apparelled and of such a beauteous
grace as that naught could surpass the same. So
attended, she did make her reverence before the King,
who did welcome her with the highest marks of honour.
And she did tarry thirteen days and thirteen nights with
him, submitting herself in all ways to his good will and
pleasure. At the same time she did frankly tell him how
that if she had a daughter by him, she would guard her as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
a most priceless treasure; but an if she had a son, that
she would send him back to the King, by reason of the
abhorrence she bear to the male sex, in the matter of holding
rule and exercising any command among them, in
accordance with the laws introduced in their companies
after they had slain their husbands.</p>

<p>Herein need we have no doubt whatever but that the
rest of the ladies and attendant dames did after a like
manner, and had themselves covered by the different captains
and men of war of the said King Alexander. For
they were bound in this matter to follow their mistress’
example.</p>

<p>So too the fair maiden Camilla, at once beautiful and
noble-hearted, and one which did serve her mistress Diana
right faithfully in the woodlands and forests on her hunting
parties, having heard the bruit of Turnus’ valiance,
and how he had to do with another valiant warrior, to wit
Aeneas, which did press him sore, did choose her side.
Then did she seek out her favourite and join him, but
with three very honourable and fair ladies beside for her
comrades, the which she had taken for her close friends
and trusty confidantes,—and for tribads too mayhap, and
for mutual naughtiness. And so did she hold these same
in honour and use them on all occasions, as Virgil doth
describe in his <i>Æneid</i>. And they were called the one
Armia, a virgin and a valiant maid, another Tullia, and
the third Tarpeia, which was skilled to wield the pike and
dart, and that in two divers fashions, be it understood,—all
three being daughters of
<span class="no-wrap">Italy.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3*]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus then did Camilla arrive with her beauteous little
band (as they say “little and good”) for to seek out
Turnus, with whom she did perform sundry excellent feats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
of arms; and did sally forth so oft and join battle with
the doughty Trojans that she was presently slain, to the
very sore grief of Turnus, who did regard her most
highly, as well for her beauty as for the good succour she
brought. In such wise did these fair and courageous
dames seek out brave and valiant heroes, succouring the
same in their ways and encounters.</p>

<p>What else was it did fill the breast of poor Dido with
the flame of so ardent a love, what but the valiance she did
feel to be in her Aeneas,—if we are to credit Virgil? For
she had begged him to tell her of his wars, and the ruin
and destruction of Troy, and he had gratified her wish,—albeit
to his own great grief, to renew the memory of such
sorrows, and in his discourse had dwelt by the way on his
own valiant achievements. And Dido having well marked
all these and pondered them in her breast, and presently
declaring of her love to her sister Anna, the chiefest and
most pregnant of the words she said to her were these
and no other: “Ah! sister mine, what a guest is this which
hath come to my Court! Oh! the noble way he hath with
him, and how his very carriage doth announce him a brave
and most valiant warrior, in deed and in spirit! I do
firmly believe him to be the offspring of some race of gods;
for churlish hearts are ever cowardly of their very
nature.” Such were Dido’s words; and I think she did
come to love him so, quite as much because she was herself
brave and generous-hearted, and that her instinct
did push her to love her fellow, as to win help and service
of him in case of need. But the wretch did deceive and
desert her in pitiful wise,—an ill deed he should never
have done to so honourable a lady, which had given him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
her heart and her love, to him, I say, that was but a
stranger and an outlaw.</p>

<p>Boccaccio in his book of <i>Famous Folk which have been</i>
<span class="no-wrap"><i>Unfortunate</i>,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
doth tell a tale of a certain
Duchess of Forli, named Romilda, who having lost
husband and lands and goods, all which Caucan,
King of the Avarese, had robbed her of, was
constrained to take refuge with her children in her castle
of Forli, and was therein besieged by him. But one
day when he did approach near the walls to make a
reconnaissance, Romilda who was on the top of a tower,
saw him and did long and carefully observe him. Then
seeing him so handsome, being in the flower of his age,
mounted on a fine horse and clad in a magnificent suit
of mail, and knowing how he was used to do many doughty
deeds of war, and that he did never spare himself any
more than the least of his soldiers, she did incontinently
fall deeply enamoured of the man, and quitting to mourn
for her husband and all care for her castle and the siege
thereof, did send him word by a messenger that, if he
would have her in marriage, she would yield him up the
place on the day their wedding should be celebrated.</p>

<p>King Caucan took her at her word. Accordingly the
day agreed upon being come, lo! she doth deck herself
most stately as a duchess should in her finest and most
magnificent attire, which did make her yet fairer still to
look on, exceeding fair as she was by nature. So having
come to the King’s camp for to consummate the marriage,
this last, to the end he might not be blamed as not having
kept his word, did spend all that night in satisfying the
enamoured duchess’s desires. But the next morning, on
rising, he did have a dozen Averese soldiers of his called,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
such as he deemed to be the strongest and most stalwart
fellows, and gave Romilda into their hands, to take their
pleasure of her one after other. These did have her for
all a night long so oft as ever they could. But then,
when day was come again, Caucan having summoned her
before him, and after sternly upbraiding her for her wantonness
and heaping many insults upon her, did have her
impaled through her belly, of which cruel treatment she
did presently die. Truly a savage and barbarous act, so
to mishandle a fair and honourable lady, instead of displaying
gratitude, rewarding her and treating her with all
possible courtesy, for the good opinion she had showed of
his generosity, valour and noble courage, and her love for
him therefor! And of this must fair ladies sometimes have
good heed; for of these valiant men of war there be some
which have so grown accustomed to killing and slashing
and savagely plying the steel, that now and again it doth
take their humour to exercise the like barbarity on women.
Yet are not all of this complexion, but rather, when
honourable ladies do them this honour to love them and
hold their valour in high esteem, they do leave behind in
camp their fury and fierce passions, and in court and
ladies’ chambers do fit themselves to the practise of all
gentleness and kindness and fair courtesy.</p>

<p>Bandello in his <i>Tragic</i>
<span class="no-wrap"><i>Histories</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
doth relate one, the
finest story I have ever read, of a certain Duchess of
Savoy, who one day coming forth from her good town of
Turin, did hear a Spanish woman, a pilgrim on her road to
Loretto to perform a vow, cry out and admire her beauty
and loudly declare, how that if only so fair and perfect a
lady were wedded to her brother, the Señor de Mendoza,
which was himself so handsome, brave and valiant, folk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
might well say in all lands that now the finest and handsomest
couple in all the world were mated together. The
Duchess who did very well understand the Spanish tongue,
having graven these words in her breast and pondered
them over in her heart, did anon begin to grave love in
the same place likewise. In such wise that by this report
of his merits she did fall so passionately in love with the
Señor de Mendoza as that she did never slacken till she
had planned a pretended pilgrimage to St. James of Compostella,
for to see the man for whom she had so suddenly
been smit with love. So having journeyed to Spain, and
taken the road passing by the house of de Mendoza, she
had time and leisure to content and satisfy her eyes with
a good sight of the fair object she had chosen. For the
Señor de Mendoza’s sister, which was in the Duchess’
train, had advised her brother of so distinguished and fair
a visitor’s coming. Wherefore he did not fail to go forth
to meet her in gallant array, and mounted on a noble
Spanish horse, and this with so fine a grace as that the
Duchess could not but be assured of the truth of the fair
report which had been given her, and did admire him
greatly, as well for his handsome person as for his noble
carriage, which did plainly manifest the valiance that was
in him. This she did esteem even more highly than all his
other merits, accomplishments and perfections, presaging
even at that date how she would one day mayhap have need
of his valour,—as truly in after times he did excellently
serve her under the false accusation which Count Pancalier
brought against her chastity. Natheless, though she did
find him brave and courageous as a man of arms, yet for
the nonce was he a recreant in love; for he did show himself
so cold and respectful toward her as to try never an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
assault of amorous words, the very thing she did most
desire, and for which she had undertook her journey.
Wherefore, in sore despite at so chilling a respect, or to
speak plainly such recreancy in love, she did part from
him on the morrow, not near so well content as she had
come.</p>

<p>Thus we see how true ’tis that ladies do sometimes love
men no less which are bold in love than they which be
brave in arms,—not that they would have them brazen
and over-bold, impudent and self-satisfied, as I have known
some to be. But in this matter must they keep ever the
<i>via media</i>.</p>

<p>I have known not a few which have lost many a good
fortune with women by reason of such over-respectfulness,
whereof I could tell some excellent stories, were I
not afeared of wandering too far from the proper subject
of my Discourse. But I hope to give them in a separate
place; so I will only tell the following one here.</p>

<p>I have heard tell in former days of a lady, and one of the
fairest in all the world, who having in the like fashion heard
a certain Prince given out by repute for brave and valiant,
and that he had already in his young days done and
performed great exploits of war, and in especial won two
great and signal victories against his
<span class="no-wrap">foes,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
did conceive a
strong desire to see him; and to this end did make a
journey to the province wherein he was then tarrying,
under some pretext or other that I need not name. Well!
at last she did set forth; and presently,—for what is
not possible to a brave and loving heart?—she doth gain
sight of him and can contemplate him at her ease, for he
did come out a long distance to meet her, and doth now
receive her with all possible honour and respect, as was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
meet for so great, fair and noble-hearted a Princess.
Nay! the respect was e’en <i>too</i> great, some do say; for
the same thing happened as with the Señor de Mendoza
and the Duchess of Savoy, and such excessive respectfulness
did but engender the like despite and dissatisfaction.
At any rate she did part from him by no means so well
satisfied as she had come. It may well be he would but
have wasted his time without her yielding one whit to his
wishes; but at the least the attempt would not have been
ill, but rather becoming to a gallant man, and folk would
have esteemed him the better therefor.</p>

<p>Why! what is the use of a bold and generous spirit,
if it show not itself in all things, as well in love as in
war? For love and arms be comrades, and do go side
by side with a single heart, as saith the Latin poet:
“Every lover is a man of war, and Cupid hath his camp
and arms no less than Mars.” Ronsard hath writ a fine
sonnet hereanent in the first book of his
<span class="no-wrap">“Amours.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7*]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">However</span> to return to the fainness women do
display to see and love great-hearted and
valiant men,—I have heard it told of the
Queen of England, Elizabeth, the same which
is yet reigning at this hour, how that one day being at
table, entertaining at supper the Grand Prior of France,
a nobleman of the house of Lorraine, and M. d’Anville,
now M. de Montmorency and Constable of France, the
table discourse having fallen among divers other matters
on the merits of the late King Henri II. of France, she
did commend that Prince most highly, for that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
so brave, and to use her own word so <i>martial</i> a monarch,
as he had manifested plainly in all his doings. For which
cause she had resolved, an if he had not died so early, to
go visit him in his Kingdom, and had actually had her
galleys prepared and made ready for to cross over into
France, and so the twain clasp hands and pledge their
faith and peaceable intent. “In fact ’twas one of my
strongest wishes to see this hero. I scarce think he would
have refused me, for,” she did declare, “my humour is to
love men of courage. And I do sore begrudge death his
having snatched away so gallant a King, at any rate before
I had looked on his face.”</p>

<p>This same Queen, some while after, having heard great
renown of the Duc de Nemours for the high qualities and
valour that were in him, was most eager to enquire news of
him from the late deceased M. de Rendan[8] at the time
when King Francis II did send him to Scotland to conclude
a peace under the walls of
<span class="no-wrap">Leith,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
which was then
besieged by the English. And so soon as he had told the
Queen at length all the particulars of that nobleman’s
high and noble deeds and merits and points of gallantry,
M. de Rendan, who was no less understanding in matters
of love than of arms, did note in her and in her countenance
a certain sparkle of love or at the least liking, as
well as in her words a very strong desire to see him.
Wherefore, fain not to stay her in so excellent a path,
he did what he could to find out from her whether, if
the Duke should come to see her, he would be welcome and
well received. She did assure him this would certainly
be so, from which he did conclude they might very well
come to be wed.</p>

<p>Presently being returned to the Court of France from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
off his embassy, he did report all the discourse to the
King and M. de Nemours. Whereupon the former did
command and urge M. de Nemours to agree to the thing.
This he did with very great alacrity, if he could come
into so fine a
<span class="no-wrap">Kingdom<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9*]</a></span>
by the means of so fair, so virtuous
and noble a Queen.</p>

<p>As a result the irons were soon in the fire. With the
good means the King did put in his hands, the Duke did
presently make very great and magnificent preparations
and equipments, both of raiment, horses and arms, and
in fact of all costly and beautiful things, without omitting
aught needful (for myself did see all this) to go and appear
before this fair Princess, above all forgetting not to
carry thither with him all the flower of the young nobility
of the Court. Indeed Greffier, the Court fool, remarking
thereupon did say ’twas wondrous how all the gay <i>pease
blossom</i> of the land was going overseas, pointing by this
his jape at the wild young bloods of the French Court.</p>

<p>Meantime M. de Lignerolles, a gentleman of much
adroitness and skill, and at that time an high favourite
with M. de Nemours, his master, was despatched to the
said fair Princess, and anon returned bearing a most
gentle answer and one very meet to content him, and
cause him to press on and further hasten his journey.
And I remember me the marriage was held at Court to
be as good as made. Yet did we observe how all of a
sudden the voyage in question was broke off short and
never made, and this in spite of a very great expenditure
thereon, now all vain and useless.</p>

<p>Myself could say as well as any man in France what
’twas did lead to this rupture; yet will I remark thus
much only in passing:—It may well be other loves did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
more move his heart, and held him more firm a captive.
For truly he was so accomplished in all ways and so skilful
in arms and all good exercises, as that ladies did vie with
each other in running after him. So I have seen some
of the most high-spirited and virtuous women which were
ready enough to break their fast of chastity for him.</p>

<p>We have, in the <i>Cent Nouvelles</i> of Queen Marguerite of
Navarre, a very excellent tale of that lady of
<span class="no-wrap">Milan,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10*]</a></span>
which having given assignation to the late M. de Bonnivet, since
that day Admiral of France, one night, did charge her
chamber-women to stand with drawn swords in hand and
to make a disturbance on the steps, just as he should be
ready to go to bed. This they did to great effect, following
therein their mistress’ orders, which for her part did
feign to be terrified and sore afraid, crying out ’twas her
husband’s brothers which had noted something amiss,
and that she was undone, and that he should hide under the
bed or behind the arras. But M. de Bonnivet, without the
least panic, taking his cloak round the one arm and
his sword in the other hand, said only: “Well, well!
where be they, these doughty brothers, which would
fright me or do me hurt? Soon as they shall see me,
they will not so much as dare look at the point of my
sword.” So saying, he did throw open the door and sally
forth, but as he was for charging down the steps, lo! he
did find only the women and their silly noise, which were
sore scared at sight of him and began to scream and confess
the whole truth. M. de Bonnivet, seeing what was
toward, did straight leave the jades, commending them
to the devil, and hying him back to the bedchamber, shutteth
to the door behind him. Thus did he betake him to
his lady once more, which did then fall a-laughing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
a-kissing of him, confessing how ’twas naught but a trick
of her contriving, and declaring, an if he had played the
poltroon and had not shown his valiance, whereof he had
the repute, that he should never have lain with her. But
seeing he had proved him so bold and confident of heart,
she did therefore kiss him and frankly welcome him to
her bed. And all night long ’twere better not to enquire
too close what they did; for indeed she was one of the fairest
women in all Milan, and one with whom he had had
much pains to win her over.</p>

<p>I once knew a gallant gentleman, who one day being at
Rome to bed with a pretty Roman lady, in her husband’s
absence, was alarmed in like wise; for she did cause one
of her waiting women to come in hot haste to warn him
the husband was hunting round. The lady, pretending
sore amazement, did beseech the gentleman to hide in a
closet, else she was undone. “No, no!” my friend made
answer, “I would not do that for all the world; but an if
he come, why! I will kill him.” With this he did spring
to grasp his sword; but the lady only fell a-laughing,
and did confess how she had arranged it all of set purpose
to prove him, to see what he would do, if her husband did
threat him with hurt, and whether he would make a good
defence of his mistress.</p>

<p>I likewise knew a very fair lady, who did quit outright
a lover she had, because she deemed him a coward; and
did change him for another, which did in no way resemble
him, but was feared and dreaded exceedingly for his
powers of fence, being one of the best swordsmen to be
found in those days.</p>

<p>I have heard a tale told at Court by the old gossips, of
a lady which was at Court, mistress of the late M. de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
<span class="no-wrap">Lorge,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
that good soldier and in his younger days one of
the bravest and most renowned captains of foot men
of his time. She having heard so much praise given to
his valour, was fain, one day that King Francis the First
was showing a fight of lions at his Court, to prove him
whether he was so brave as folk made out. Wherefore
she did drop one of her gloves in the lions’ den, whenas
they were at their fiercest; and with that did pray M. de
Lorge to go get it for her, an if his love of her were as
great as he was forever saying. He without any show
of surprise, doth take his cloak on fist and his sword in
the other hand, and so boldly forth among the lions for
to recover the glove. In this emprise was fortune so
favourable to him, that seeing he did all through show a
good front and kept the point of his sword boldly presented
to the lions, these did not dare attack him. So
after picking up the glove, he did return toward his mistress
and gave it back to her; for the which she and
all the company there present did esteem him very highly.
But ’tis said that out of sheer despite at such treatment,
M. de Lorge did quit her for ever, forasmuch as she had
thought good to make her pastime of him and his valiance
in this fashion. Nay! more, they say he did throw the
glove in her face, out of mere despite; for he had rather
an hundred times she had bid him go break up a whole
battalion of foot soldiery, a matter he was duly trained
to undertake, than thus to fight beasts, a contest where
glory is scarce to be gained. At any rate suchlike trials
of men’s courage be neither good nor honourable, and
they that do provoke the same are much to be blamed.</p>

<p>I like as little another trick which a certain lady did
play her lover. For when he was offering her his service,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
assuring her there was never a thing, be it as perilous as
it might, he would not do for her, she taking him at his
word, did reply, “Well! an if you love me so much, and
be as courageous as you say, stab yourself with your
dagger in the arm for the love of me.” The other, who
was dying for love of her, did straight draw his weapon,
ready to give himself the blow. However I did hold his
arm and took the dagger from him, remonstrating and
saying he would be a great fool to go about it in any such
fashion to prove his love and courage. I will not name
the lady; but the gentleman concerned was the late deceased
M. de Clermont-Tallard the
<span class="no-wrap">elder,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12*]</a></span>
which fell at
the battle of Montcontour, one of the bravest and most
valiant gentlemen of France, as he did show by his death,
when in command of a company of men-at-arms,—a man
I did love and honour greatly.</p>

<p>I have heard say a like thing did once happen to the
late M. de Genlis, the same which fell in Germany, leading
the Huguenot troops in the third of our wars of Religion.
For crossing the Seine one day in front of the Louvre
with his mistress, she did let fall her handkerchief, which
was a rich and beautiful one, into the water on purpose,
and told him to leap into the river to recover the same.
He, knowing not how to swim but like a stone, was fain
to be excused; but she upbraiding him and saying he was
a recreant lover, and no brave man, without a word more
he did throw himself headlong into the stream, and thinking
to get the handkerchief, would assuredly have been
drowned, had he not been promptly rescued by a boat.</p>

<p>Myself believe that suchlike women, by such trials, do
desire in this wise gracefully to be rid of their lovers,
which mayhap do weary them. ’Twere much better did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
they give them good favours once for all and pray them,
for the love they bear them, to carry these forth to honourable
and perilous places in the wars, and so prove their
valour. Thus would they push them on to greater
prowess, rather than make them perform the follies I
have just spoke of, and of which I could recount an infinity
of instances.</p>

<p>This doth remind me, how that, whenas we were advancing
to lay siege to Rouen in the first war of Religion,
Mademoiselle de
<span class="no-wrap">Piennes,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13*]</a></span>
one of the honourable damsels
of the Court, being in doubt as to whether the late M. de
Gergeay was valiant enough to have killed, himself alone
and man to man, the late deceased Baron d’Ingrande,
which was one of the most valiant gentlemen of the Court,
did for to prove his valiance, give him a favour,—a scarf
which he did affix to his head harness. Then, on occasion
of the making a reconnaissance of the Fort of St. Catherine,
he did charge so boldly and valiantly on a troop of
horse which had sallied forth of the city, that bravely
fighting he did receive a pistol shot in the head, whereof
he did fall stark dead on the spot. In this wise was the
said damsel fully satisfied of his valour, and had he not
been thus killed, seeing he had fought so well, she would
have wedded him; but doubting somewhat his courage, and
deeming he had slain the aforesaid Baron unfairly, for so
she did suspect, she was fain, as she said, to make this
visible trial of him. And verily, although there be many
men naturally courageous, yet do the ladies push the
same on to greater prowess; while if they be cold and
cowardly, they do move them to some gallantry and warm
them up to some show of fight.</p>

<p>We have an excellent example hereof in the beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Agnes Sorel,[14] who seeing the King of France Charles
VII.[14] deep in love with her, and recking of naught but to
pleasure her, and slack and cowardly take no heed for his
kingdom, did say to him one day, how that when she was
a child, an astrologer had predicted she would be loved
and served of one of the most valiant and courageous
kings of Christendom. Accordingly, whenas the King
did her the honour to love her, she did think he was the
valorous monarch which had been predicted for her; but
seeing him so slack, with so little care of his proper business,
she did plainly perceive she was deceived in this, and
that the courageous King intended was not he at all, but
the King of England,[14] which did perform such fine feats
of war, and did take so many of his fairest cities from
under his very nose. “Wherefore,” she said to her lover,
“I am away to find him, for of a surety ’tis he the astrologer
did intend.” These words did so sorely prick the
King’s heart, as that he fell a-weeping; and thenceforward,
plucking up spirit and quitting his hunting and
his gardens, he did take the bit in his teeth,—and this to
such good effect that by dint of good hap and his own
valiance he did drive the English forth of his Kingdom
altogether.</p>

<p>Bertrand du <span class="no-wrap">Guesclin<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span>
having wedded his wife Madame
Tiphaine, did set himself all to pleasure her and so did
neglect the management of the War, he who had been so
forward therein afore, and had won him such praise and
glory. But she did upbraid him with this remonstrance,
how that before their marriage folk did speak of naught
but him and his gallant deeds, but henceforth she might
well be reproached for the discontinuance of her husband’s
fair deeds and good repute. This she said was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
very great disgrace to her and him, that he had now
grown such a stay-at-home; and did never cease her chiding,
till she had roused in him his erstwhile spirit, and
sent him back to the wars, where he did even doughtier
deeds than aforetime.</p>

<p>Thus do we see how this honourable lady did not love
so much her night’s pleasures as she did value the honour
of her husband. And of a surety our wives themselves,
though they do find us near by their side, yet an if we be
not brave and valiant, will never really love us nor keep
us by them of good and willing heart; whereas when we
be returned from the wars and have done some fine and
noble exploit, then they do verily and indeed love us and
embrace of right good will, and themselves find the enjoyment
most precious.</p>

<p>The fourth daughter of the Comte de
<span class="no-wrap">Provence,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15*]</a></span>
father-in-law
of St. Louis, and herself wife to Charles, Count of
Anjou, brother of the said King, being sore vexed, high-spirited
and ambitious Princess as she was, at being but
plain Countess of Anjou and Provence, and because she
alone of her three sisters, of whom two were Queens and
the third Empress, did bear no better title than that my
Lady and Countess, did never cease till she had prayed,
beseeched and importuned her husband to conquer and
get some Kingdom for himself. And they did contrive
so well as that they were chose of Pope Urban to be King
and Queen of the Two Sicilies; and they did away, the
twain of them, to Rome with thirty galleys to be crowned
by his Holiness, with all state and splendour, King and
Queen of Jerusalem and Naples, which dominion he did
win afterward, no less by his victorious arms than by the
aid his wife afforded him, selling all her rings and jewels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
for to provide the expenses of the war. So thereafter
did they twain reign long and not unpeaceably in the
fine kingdoms they had gotten.</p>

<p>Long years after, one of their grand-daughters, issue
of them and theirs, Ysabeau de Lorraine to
<span class="no-wrap">wit,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16*]</a></span>
without help of her husband René, did carry out a like emprise.
For while her husband was prisoner in the hands of
Charles, Duke of Burgundy, she being a Princess of a
wise prudence and high heart and courage, the Kingdom
of Sicily and Naples having meantime fallen to them in
due succession, did assemble an army of thirty thousand
men. This she did lead forth in person, and so conquer
all the Kingdom and take possession of Naples.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I could</span> name an host of ladies which have
in suchlike ways done great and good service
to their husbands, and how being high of
heart and ambition they have pushed on and
encouraged their mates to court fortune, and to win
goods and grandeur and much wealth. And truly ’tis
the most noble and most honourable fashion of getting
of such things, thus at the sword’s point.</p>

<p>I have known many men in this our land of France
and at our Courts, which really more by the urging of
their wives than by any will of their own, have undertaken
and accomplished gallant exploits.</p>

<p>Many women on the other hand have I known, which
thinking only of their own good pleasures, have stood in
their husbands’ way and kept the same ever by their side,
hindering them of doing noble deeds, unwilling to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
them find amusement in aught else but in contenting them
at the game of Venus, so keen were they after this sport.
I could tell many a tale hereof, but I should be going too
far astray from my subject, which is a worthier one for
sure, seeing it doth handle virtue, than the other, which
hath to do with vice. ’Tis more pleasant by far to hear
tell of such ladies as have pushed on their men to noble
deeds. Nor do I speak solely of married women, but of
many others beside, which by dint of one little favour bestowed,
have made their lovers to do many a fine thing
they had never done else. For what a satisfaction is
theirs! what incitement and warming of heart is greater
than when at the wars a man doth think how he is well
loved of his mistress, and if only he do some fine thing
for the love of her, what kind looks and pretty ways,
what fair glances, what kissings, delights and joys, he
may hope after to receive of her?</p>

<p>Scipio amongst other rebukes he did administer to
Massinissa, when, all but bloody yet from battle, he did
wed Sophonisba, said to him: how that ’twas ill-becoming
to think of ladies and the love of ladies, when at the wars.
He must pardon me here, an if he will; but for my own
part, I ween there is no such great contentment, nor one
that giveth more courage and emulation to do nobly than
they. I have travelled in that country myself in old
days. And not only I, but all such, I do firmly believe, as
take the field and fight, do find the same; and to them I
make appeal. I am sure they be all of my opinion, be
they who they may, and that whenas they are embarked
on some good warlike emprise, and presently find themselves
in the heat of battle and press of the foe, their heart
doth swell within them as they think on their ladies, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
favours they do carry of them, and the caresses and gentle
welcome they will receive of the same after the war is
done, if they but escape,—and if they come to die, the
sore grief they will feel for love of them and thought of
their end. In a word, for the love of their ladies and
fond thoughts of them, all emprises be facile and easy,
the sternest fights be but merry tourneys to them, and
death itself a triumph.</p>

<p>I do remember me how at the battle of Dreux the late
M. des <span class="no-wrap">Bordes,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17*]</a></span>
a brave and gentle knight if ever there was
one in his day, being Lieutenant under M. de Nevers,
known at the first as the Comte d’Eu, a most excellent
Prince and soldier, when he had to charge to break up a
battalion of foot which was marching straight on the
advanced guard where was the late M. de Guise the Great,
and the signal to charge was given, the said Des Bordes,
mounted on a grey barb, doth start forward instantly,
adorned and garnished with a very fine favour his mistress
had given him (I will not name her, but she was one
of the fair and honourable damsels and great ladies of
the Court), and as he gave rein, he did cry: “Ha! I am
away to fight valiantly for the love of my mistress, or to
die for her!” And this boast he failed not to fulfil; for
after piercing the six first ranks, he fell at the seventh,
borne down to earth. Now tell me if this lady had not
well used her favour, and if she had aught to reproach
her with for having bestowed it on him!</p>

<p>M. de Bussi again was a young soldier which did as
great honour to his mistresses’ favours as any man of his
time, yea! and the favours of some I know of, which did
merit more stricken fields and deeds of daring and good
sword thrusts than did ever the fair Angelica of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Paladins and Knights of yore, whether Christian or Saracen.
Yet have I heard him often declare that in all the
single combats and wars and general rencounters (for he
hath fought in many such) where he hath ever been engaged,
’twas not so much for the service of his Prince
nor yet for love of success as for the sole honour and
glory of contenting his lady love. He was surely right
in this, for verily all the success in the world and all its
ambitions be little worth in comparison of the love and
kindness of a fair and honourable lady and mistress.</p>

<p>And why else have so many brave Knights errant of the
Round Table and so many valorous Paladins of France
in olden time undertaken so many wars and far journeyings,
and gone forth on such gallant emprises, if not
for the love of the fair ladies they did serve or were fain
to serve? I do appeal to our Paladins of France, our
Rolands, Renauds, Ogiers, our Olivers, Yvons and Richards,
and an host of others. And truly ’twas a good
time and a lucky; for if they did accomplish some gallant
deed for love of their ladies, these same fair ladies, in
no wise ingrate, knew well how to reward them, whenas
they hied them back to meet them, or mayhap would give
them tryst there, in the forests and woodlands, or near
some fair fountain or amid the green meadows. And is
not this the guerdon of his doughtiness a soldier most
doth crave of his lady love?</p>

<p>Well! it yet remains to ask, why women do so love
these men of valiance? First, as I did say at the beginning,
valour hath in it a certain force and overmastering
power to make itself loved of its opposite. Then beside,
there is a kind of natural inclination doth exist,
constraining women to love great-heartedness, which to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
sure is an hundred times more lovable than cowardice,—even
as virtue is alway more to be desired than vice.</p>

<p>Some ladies there be which do love men thus gifted with
valour, because they imagine that just as they be brave
and expert at arms and in the trade of War, they must
be the same at that of Love.</p>

<p>And this rule doth hold really good with some. ’Twas
fulfilled for instance by Cæsar, that champion of the
world, and many another gallant soldier I have known,
though I name no names. And such lovers do possess
a very different sort of vigour and charm from rustics
and folk of any other profession but that of arms, so
much so that one push of these same gallants is worth
four of ordinary folk. When I say this, I do mean in
the eyes of women moderately lustful, not of such as be
inordinately so, for the mere number is what pleaseth
this latter sort. But if this rule doth hold good sometimes
in some of these warlike fellows, and according to
the humour of some women, it doth fail in others; for
some of these valiant soldiers there be so broken down
by the burden of their harness and the heavy tasks of
war, that they have no strength left when they have to
come to this gentle game of love, in such wise that they
cannot content their ladies,—of whom some (and many
are of such complexion), had liever have one good workman
at Venus’ trade, fresh and ground to a good point,
than four of these sons of Mars, thus broken-winged.</p>

<p>I have known many of the sex of this sort and this
humour; for after all, they say, the great thing is to pass
one’s time merrily, and get the quintessence of enjoyment
out of it, without any special choice of persons. A good
man of war is good, and a fine sight on the field of battle;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
but an if he can do naught a-bed, they declare, a good
stout lackey, in good case and practice, is every whit as
worth having as a handsome and valiant gentleman,—tired
out.</p>

<p>I do refer me to such dames as have made trial thereof,
and do so every day; for the gallant soldier’s loins, be he
as brave and valiant as he may, being broken and chafed
of the harness they have so long carried on them, cannot
afford the needful supply, as other men do, which have
never borne hardship or fatigue.</p>

<p>Other ladies there be which do love brave men, whether
it be for husbands or for lovers, to the end these may
show good fight and so better defend their honour and
chastity, if any detractors should be fain to befoul these
with ill words. Several such I have seen at Court, where
I knew in former days a very great and a very fair lady[18]
whose name I had rather not give, who being much subject
to evil tongues, did quit a lover, and a very favourite
one, she had, seeing him backward to come to blows
and pick a quarrel and fight it out, to take
<span class="no-wrap">another<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span>
instead which was a mettlesome wight, a brave and valiant
soul, which would gallantly bear his lady’s honour on the
point of his sword, without ever a man daring to touch
the same in any wise.</p>

<p>Many ladies have I known in my time of this humour,
wishful always to have a brave gallant for their escort and
defence. This no doubt is a good and very useful thing
oftentimes for them; but then they must take good heed
not to stumble or let their heart change toward them, once
they have submitted to their domination. For if these
fellows do note the least in the world of their pranks and
fickle changes, they do lead them a fine life and rebuke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
them in terrible wise, both them and their new gallants,
if ever they change. Of this I have seen not a few examples
in the course of my life.</p>

<p>Thus do we see how suchlike women, those that will fain
have at command suchlike brave and mettlesome lovers,
must needs themselves be brave and very faithful in their
dealings with the same, or at any rate so secret in their
intrigues as that they may never be discovered. Unless
indeed they do compass the thing by some arrangement,
as do the Italian and Roman courtesans, who are fain
ever to have a <i>bravo</i> (this is the name they give him) to
defend and keep them in countenance; but ’tis always part
of the bargain that they shall have other favoured swains
as well, and the bravo shall never say one word.</p>

<p>This is mighty well for the courtesans of Rome and
their bravos, but not for the gallant gentlemen of France
and other lands. But an if an honourable dame is ready
to keep herself in all firmness and constancy, her lover is
bound to spare his life in no way for to maintain and
defend her honour, if she do run the very smallest risk
of hurt, whether to her life or her reputation, or of some
ill word of scandal. So have I seen at our own Court
several which have made evil tattlers to hold their tongues
at a moment’s notice, when these had started some detraction
of their ladies or mistresses. For by devoir of
knighthood and its laws we be bound to serve as their
champions in any trouble, as did the brave Renaud for the
fair Ginevra in <span class="no-wrap">Scotland,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span>
the Señor de Mendoza for the
beautiful Duchess I have spoke of above, and the Seigneur
de Carouge for his own wedded wife in the days of King
Charles VI., as we do read in our Chronicles. I could
quote an host of other instances, as well of old as of modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
times, to say naught of those I have witnessed at our
own Court; but I should never have done.</p>

<p>Other ladies I have known which have quitted cowardly
fellows, albeit these were very rich, to love and wed gentlemen
that did possess naught at all but sword and cloak,
so to say. But then they were valorous and great-hearted,
and had hopes, by dint of their valiance and
bravery, to attain to rank and high estate. Though truly
’tis not the bravest that do most oft win these prizes;
but they do rather suffer sore wrong, while many a time
we behold the cowardly and fainthearted succeed instead.
Yet be this as it may, such fortune doth never become
these so well as it doth the men of valour.</p>

<p>But there, I should never get me done, were I to recount
at length the divers causes and reasons why women do so
love men of high heart and courage. I am quite sure,
were I set on amplifying this Discourse with all the host
of reasons and examples I might, I could make a whole
book of it alone. However, as I wish not to tarry over
one subject only, so much as to deal with various and
divers matters, I will be satisfied to have said what I
have said,—albeit sundry will likely blame me, how that
such and such a point was surely worthy of being enriched
by more instances and a string of prolix reasons,
which themselves could very well supply, exclaiming,
“Why! he hath clean forgot this; he hath clean forgot
that.” I know my subject well enough for all that; and
mayhap I know more instances than ever they could adduce,
and more startling and private. But I prefer not
to divulge them all, and not to give the names.</p>

<p>This is why I do hold my tongue. Yet, before making
an end, I will add this further word by the way. Just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
as ladies do love men which be valiant and bold under
arms, so likewise do they love such as be of like sort in
love; and the man which is cowardly and over and above
respectful toward them, will never win their good favour.
Not that they would have them so overweening, bold and
presumptuous, as that they should by main force lay
them on the floor; but rather they desire in them a certain
hardy modesty, or perhaps better a certain modest
hardihood. For while themselves are not exactly wantons,
and will neither solicit a man nor yet actually offer their
favours, yet do they know well how to rouse the appetites
and passions, and prettily allure to the skirmish in such
wise that he which doth not take occasion by the forelock
and join encounter, and that without the least awe of
rank and greatness, without a scruple of conscience or
a fear or any sort of hesitation, he verily is a fool and
a spiritless poltroon, and one which doth merit to be forever
abandoned of kind <span class="no-wrap">fortune.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20*]</a></span></p>

<p>I have heard of two honourable gentlemen and comrades,
for the which two very honourable ladies, and of by
no means humble quality, made tryst one day at Paris
to go walking in a garden. Being come thither, each
lady did separate apart one from the other, each alone
with her own cavalier, each in a several alley of the garden,
that was so close covered in with a fair trellis of
boughs as that daylight could really scarce penetrate
there at all, and the coolness of the place was very grateful.
Now one of the twain was a bold man, and well
knowing how the party had been made for something else
than merely to walk and take the air, and judging by
his lady’s face, which he saw to be all a-fire, that she had
longings to taste other fare than the muscatels that hung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
on the trellis, as also by her hot, wanton and wild speech,
he did promptly seize on so fair an opportunity. So
catching hold of her without the least ceremony, he did
lay her on a little couch that was there made of turf and
clods of earth, and did very pleasantly work his will of
her, without her ever uttering a word but only: “Heavens!
Sir, what are you at? Surely you be the maddest
and strangest fellow ever was! If anyone comes, whatever
will they say? Great heavens! get out!” But the
gentleman, without disturbing himself, did so well continue
what he had begun that he did finish, and she to boot, with
such content as that after taking three or four turns up
and down the alley, they did presently start afresh.
Anon, coming forth into another, open, alley, they did
see in another part of the garden the other pair, who
were walking about together just as they had left them
at first. Whereupon the lady, well content, did say to
the gentleman in the like condition, “I verily believe so
and so hath played the silly prude, and hath given his
lady no other entertainment but only words, fine speeches
and promenading.”</p>

<p>Afterward when all four were come together, the two
ladies did fall to asking one another how it had fared with
each. Then the one which was well content did reply
she was exceeding well, indeed she was; indeed for the
nonce she could scarce be better. The other, which was
ill content, did declare for her part she had had to do
with the biggest fool and most coward lover she had ever
seen; and all the time the two gentlemen could see them
laughing together as they walked and crying out: “Oh!
the silly fool! the shamefaced poltroon and coward!” At
this the successful gallant said to his companion: “Hark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
to our ladies, which do cry out at you, and mock you sore.
You will find you have overplayed the prude and coxcomb
this bout.” So much he did allow; but there was no more
time to remedy his error, for opportunity gave him no
other handle to seize her by. Natheless, now recognizing
his mistake, after some while he did repair the same by
certain other means which I could tell, an if I would.</p>

<p>Again I knew once two great Lords, brothers, both of
them highly bred and highly accomplished
<span class="no-wrap">gentlemen<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
which did love two ladies, but the one of these was of much
higher quality and more account than the other in all
respects. Now being entered both into the chamber of
this great lady, who for the time being was keeping her
bed, each did withdraw apart for to entertain his mistress.
The one did converse with the high-born dame
with every possible respect and humble salutation and
kissing of hands, with words of honour and stately compliment,
without making ever an attempt to come near
and try to force the place. The other brother, without
any ceremony of words or fine phrases, did take his fair
one to a recessed window, and incontinently making free
with her (for he was very strong), he did soon show her
’twas not his way to love <i>à l’espagnole</i>, with eyes and
tricks of face and words, but in the genuine fashion and
proper mode every true lover should desire. Presently
having finished his task, he doth quit the chamber; but as
he goes, saith to his brother, loud enough for his lady
to hear the words: “Do you as I have done, brother
mine; else you do naught at all. Be you as brave and
hardy as you will elsewhere, yet if you show not your
hardihood here and now, you are disgraced; for here is
no place of ceremony and respect, but one where you do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
see your lady before you, which doth but wait your attack.”
So with this he did leave his brother, which yet
for that while did refrain him and put it off to another
time. But for this the lady did by no means esteem him
more highly, whether it was she did put it down to an
over chilliness in love, or a lack of courage, or a defect of
bodily vigour. And still he had shown prowess enough
elsewhere, both in war and love.</p>

<p>The late deceased Queen Mother did one day cause to
be played, for a Shrove Tuesday interlude, at Paris at the
Hôtel de Reims, a very excellent Comedy which Cornelio
Fiasco, Captain of the Royal Galleys, had devised. All
the Court was present, both men and ladies, and many
folk beside of the city. Amongst other matters, was
shown a young man which had laid hid a whole night
long in a very fair lady’s bedchamber, yet had never laid
finger on her. Telling this hap to his friend, the latter
asketh him: <i>Ch’avete fatto?</i> (What did you do?), to which
the other maketh answer: <i>Niente</i> (Nothing). On hearing
this, his friend doth exclaim: <i>Ah! poltronazzo, senza
cuore! non havete fatto niente! che maldita sia la tua poltronneria!</i>—“Oh!
poltroon and spiritless! you did nothing!
a curse on your poltroonery then!”</p>

<p>The same evening after the playing of this Comedy, as
we were assembled in the Queen’s chamber, and were discoursing
of the said play, I did ask a very fair and honourable
lady, whose name I will not give, what were the
finest points she had noted and observed in the Comedy,
and which had most pleased her. She told me quite
simply and frankly: The best point I noted was when
his friend did make answer to the young man called Lucio,
who had told him <i>che non haveva fatto niente</i> (that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
done nothing) in this wise, <i>Ah poltronazzo! non havete
fatto niente! che maldita sia la tua poltronneria!</i>—“Oh!
you poltroon! you did nothing! a curse be on your poltroonery!”</p>

<p>So you see how this fair lady which did talk with me
was in agreement with the friend in reprobating his poltroonery,
and that she did in no wise approve of him for
having been so slack and unenterprising. Thereafter she
and I did more openly discourse together of the mistakes
men make by not seizing opportunity and taking advantage
of the wind when it bloweth fair, as doth the good
mariner.</p>

<p>This bringeth me to yet another tale, which I am fain,
diverting and droll as it is, to mingle among the more
serious ones. Well, then! I have heard it told by an
honourable gentleman and a good friend of mine own,
how a lady of his native place, having often shown great
familiarities and special favour to one of her chamber
lackeys, which did only need time and opportunity to come
to a point, the said lackey, neither a prude nor a fool,
finding his mistress one morning half asleep and lying on
her bed, turned over away from the wall, tempted by such
a display of beauty and a posture making it so easy and
convenient, she being at the very edge of the bed, he did
come up softly, and alongside the lady. She turning her
head saw ’twas her lackey, which she was fain of; and just
as she was, her place occupied and all, without withdrawing
or moving one whit, and neither resisting nor trying in
the very least to shake off the hold he had of her, did only
say to him, turning round her head only and holding still
for fear of losing him, “Ho! ho! Mister prude, and what
hath made you so bold as to do this?” The lackey did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
answer with all proper respect, “Madam, shall I leave?”—“That’s
not what I said, Mister prude,” the lady replied,
“I ask you, what made you so bold as to put yourself
there?” But the other did ever come back to the same
question, “Madam, shall I stop? if you wish, I will go
out,”—and she to repeating again and again, “That is
not what I say, not what I say, Mister prude!” In fact,
the pair of them did make these same replies and repetitions
three or four times over,—which did please the lady
far better than if she had ordered her gallant to stop,
when he did ask her. Thus it did serve her well to stick
to her first question without ever a variation, and the
lover in his reply and the repetition thereof. And in this
wise did they continue to lie together for long after, the
same rubric being always repeated as an accompaniment.
For ’tis, as men say, the first batch only, and the first
measure of wine, that costs dear.</p>

<p>A good lackey and an enterprising! To such bold
fellows we must needs say in the words of the Italian
proverb, <i>A bravo cazzo mai non manca favor</i>.</p>

<p>Well, from all this you learn how that there be many
men which are brave, bold and valiant, as well in arms as
in love; others which be so in arms, but not in love; others
again, which be so in love and not in arms. Of this last
sort was that rascally Paris, who indeed had hardihood
and valiance enough to carry off Helen from her poor
cuckold of a husband Menelaus, but not to do battle with
him before Troy town.</p>

<p>Moreover this is why the ladies love not old men, nor
such as be too far advanced in years, seeing such be very
timid in love and shamefaced at asking favours. This is
not because they have not concupiscence and desires as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
great as young men, or even greater, but because they
have not the powers to match. And this is what a Spanish
lady meant, which said once: how that old men did
much resemble persons who, whenas they do behold kings
in their magnificence, domination and authority, do covet
exceedingly to be like them, yet would they never dare
to make any attempt against them to dispossess them of
their kingdoms and seize their place. She was used further
to say, <i>Y a penas es nacido el deseo, cuando se muere
luego</i>,—“Scarce is the desire born, but it dies straightway.”
Thus old men, when they do see fair objects of
attack, dare not take action, <i>porque los viejos naturalmente
son temerosos; y amor y temor no se caben en un
saco</i>,—“for that old men are naturally timid; and love
and fear do never go well in one pack.” And indeed they
are quite right; for they have arms neither for offence nor
defence, like young folks, which have youth and beauty
on their side. So verily, as saith the poet: naught is
unbecoming to youth, do what it will; and as another
hath it: two sorry sights,—an old man-at-arms and an
old lover.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_w_coloured.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Well</span>! enough hath been said on this subject; so
I do here make an end and speak no more
thereof. Only will I add somewhat on another
point, one that is appertinent and belonging
as it were to this, to wit: how just as fair ladies
do love brave men, and such as be valorous and great-hearted,
in like wise do men love women brave of heart
and noble-spirited. And as noble-spirited and courageous
men be ever more lovable and admirable than others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
so is the like true of illustrious, noble-hearted and
courageous dames,—not that I would have these perform
the deeds of men, nor yet arm and accoutre them like a
man,—as I have seen and known, as well as heard tell
of, some which would mount a-horse-back like a man,
carry their pistol at saddle-bow, shoot off the same, and
generally fight like a man.</p>

<p>I could name one famous instance at any rate of a lady
which did all this during the recent Wars of the
<span class="no-wrap">League.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22*]</a></span>
But truly suchlike disguisement is an outrage to the sex.
Besides its being neither becoming nor suitable, ’tis not
lawful, and doth bring more harm and ill repute than
many do suppose. Thus it did work great hurt to the
gentle Maid of Orleans, who at her trial was sore calumniated
on this very account, and this was in part cause of
her sore and piteous downfall and death. Wherefore such
masqueradings do like me not, nor stir me to any great
admiration. Yet do I approve and much esteem a fair
dame which doth make manifest her courageous and
valiant spirit, being in adversity and downright need, by
brave, womanly acts that do show a man’s heart and courage.
Without borrowing examples from the noble-hearted
dames of Rome and of Sparta of yore, the which
have excelled herein all other women in the world, there
be others plain enough to be seen before our very eyes;
and I do choose rather to adduce such modern instances
belonging to our own day.</p>

<p>The first example I shall give, and in my eyes the finest
I know of is that of those fair, honourable and doughty
dames of Sienna, at the time of the revolt of their city
against the intolerable yoke of the Imperialists (Ghibellines).
For after the dispositions had been fixed for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
defence, the women of the city, being set aside therein as
not apt for war like the men, were fain to make a display
of their mettle, and show how that they could do something
else than only ply their female tasks of day and
night. So, to bear their part of the work of defence,
they did divide them into three bands or companies; and
one St. Anthony’s day, in the month of January, they
did appear in public led by three of the fairest ladies, and
the greatest and best born, of all the city, in the Great
Square of that town (and it is a very noble one), with
their drums and ensigns.</p>

<p>The first was the Signora Forteguerra, clad in violet,
her ensign of the same colour and all her company in like
array, her banner bearing this device: <i>Pur che sia il vero</i>
(Let the truth prevail). Now all these ladies were dressed
in the guise of nymphs, with short skirts which did best
discover and display the fine leg beneath. The second
was the Signora Piccolomini, clad in scarlet, and her company
and ensign the same, with a white cross and this device:
<i>Pur che no l’habbia tutto</i> (Let him not have it all).
The third was the Signora Livia Fausta, clad all in white,
and her company in white and a white ensign, whereon
was a palm, and for device: <i>Pur che l’habbia</i> (Let him
have it, then!).</p>

<p>Round about and in the train of these three, which did
seem very goddesses, were a good three thousand other
women, both gentlewomen, citizens’ wives and others, all
fair to look upon, and all duly clad in their proper dress
and livery, whether of satin, taffety, damask, or other
silken stuff, and each and all firm resolved to live or die
for freedom. Moreover each did carry a fascine on her
shoulder for a fort which was a-building, while all cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
out together, <i>France, France!</i> With this spectacle, so
rare and delightsome an one, the Cardinal of Ferrara and
M. de Termes, the French King’s Lieutenants, were so
ravished, as that they did find no other pleasure but only
in watching, admiring and commending these same fair
and honourable ladies. And of a truth I have heard
many say, both men and women, which were there present,
that never was seen so fine a sight. And God knoweth,
beautiful women be not lacking in this city of Sienna,
and that in abundance, and without picking and choosing.</p>

<p>The men of the city, which of their own wishes were
greatly set on winning their freedom, were yet more encouraged
to the same by this noble display, unwilling to
fall below the women in zeal. In such wise that all did
vie with one another, Lords, gentlemen, citizens, trades-folk,
artizans, rich and poor alike, and all did flock to
the fort to imitate the example of these fair, virtuous
and honourable dames. So all in much emulation,—and
not laymen alone, but churchmen to boot,—did join in
pushing on the good work. Then, on returning back
from the fort, the men on one side, and the women likewise
ranged in battle array in the great square before
the Palace of the <span class="no-wrap">Signoria,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23*]</a></span>
they did advance one after
other, and company after company, to salute the image of
the Blessed Virgin, patroness of the city, singing the while
sundry hymns and canticles in her honour, to airs so soft
and with so gracious an harmony that, part of pleasure,
part of pity, tears ’gan fall from the eyes of all the people
present. These after receiving the benediction of the
most reverend Cardinal of Ferrara, did withdraw, each
to their own abode,—all the whole folk, men and women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
alike, with fixed resolve to do their duty yet better for
the future.</p>

<p>This sacred ceremony of these ladies doth remind me
(but without making comparison ’twixt the two) of a
heathen one, yet goodly withal, which was performed at
Rome at the period of the Punic Wars, as we do read in
the Historian <span class="no-wrap">Livy.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24*]</a></span>
’Twas a solemn progress and procession
made by three times nine, which is twenty-seven,
young and pretty Roman maids, all of them virgins, clad
in longish frocks, of which history doth not however tell
us the colours. These dainty maids, their solemn march
and procession completed, did then make halt at a certain
spot, where they proceeded to dance a measure before the
assembled people, passing from hand to hand a cord or
ribband, ranged all in order one after other, and stepping
a round, accommodating the motion and twinkling of their
feet to the cadence of the tune and the song they sang
the while. It was a right pretty sight to see, no less
for the beauty of the maids than for their sweet grace,
their dainty way of dancing and the adroit tripping of
their feet, the which is one of the chiefest charms of a
maid, when she is skilled to move and guide the same
daintily and well.</p>

<p>I have oft pictured to myself the measure they did so
dance; and it hath brought to my mind one I have seen
performed in my young days by the girls of mine own
countryside, called the “garter.” In this, the village
girls, giving and taking the garter from hand to hand,
would pass and re-pass these above their heads, then entangle
and interlace the same between their legs, leaping
nimbly over them, then unwinding them and slipping free
with little, dainty bounds,—all this while keeping rank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
one after other, without once losing cadence with the song
or instrument of music which led the measure, in such
wise that the thing was a mighty pretty thing to see. For
the little leaps and bounds they gave, the interlacing and
slipping free again, the wielding of the garter and the
graceful carriage of the girls, did all provoke so dainty
a smack of naughtiness, as that I do marvel much the
said dance hath never been practised at Court in these
days of ours. Pleasant ’tis to see the dainty drawers,
and the fine leg freely exhibited in this dance, and which
lass hath the best fitting shoe and the most alluring mien.
But truly it can be better appreciated by the eye than
described in words.</p>

<p>But to return to our ladies of Sienna. Ah! fair and
valiant dames, you should surely never die,—you nor your
glory, which will be for ever immortal. So too another
fair and gentle maid of your city, who during its siege,
seeing one night her brother kept a prisoner by sickness
in his bed and in very ill case to go on guard, doth leave
him there a-bed and slipping quietly away from his side,
doth take his arms and accoutrements, and so, a very
perfect likeness of her brother, maketh appearance with
the watch. Nor was she discovered, but by favour of
the night was really taken for him she did represent. A
gentle act, in truth! for albeit she had donned a man’s
dress and arms, yet was it not to make a constant habit
thereof, but for the nonce only to do a good office for her
brother. And indeed ’tis said no love is like that of
brother and sister, and further that in a good cause no
risk should be spared to show a gentle intrepidity of heart,
in whatsoever place it be.</p>

<p>I ween the corporal of the guard which was then in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
command of the squad in which was this fair girl, when
he wist of her act, was sore vexed he had not better recognized
her, so to have published abroad her merit on the
spot, or mayhap to have relieved her of standing sentry,
or else merely to have taken his pleasure in gazing on her
beauty and grace, and her military bearing; for no doubt
at all she did study in all things to counterfeit a soldier’s
mien.</p>

<p>Of a surety so fine a deed could scarce be overpraised,
and above all when the occasion was so excellent, and the
thing carried out for a brother’s sake. The like was done
by the gentle Richardet, in the Romance, but for different
purpose, when after hearing one evening his sister
Bramante discourse of the beauties of the fair Princess
of Spain, and of her own love and vain desires after her,
he did take her accoutrements and fine frock, after she
was to bed, and so disguiseth himself in the likeness of his
sister,—the which he could readily accomplish, so like
they were in face and beauty. Then presently, under this
feigned form he did win from the said lovely Princess what
was denied his sister by reason of her sex. Whereof, however,
great hurt had come to him, but for the favour of
Roger, who taking him for his mistress Bramante, did
save him scatheless of <span class="no-wrap">death.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Now as to the ladies of Sienna, I have heard it of M. de
La Chapelle des Ursins, which was at that time in Italy,
and did make report of this their gallant exploit to our
late King Henri II. of France, how that this monarch
did find the same so noble, that with tears in his eyes he
took an oath, an if one day God should grant him peace
or truce with the Emperor, he would hie him with his
galleys across the Tuscan sea, and so to Sienna, to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
this city so well affected to him and his party, and thank
the citizens for their good will and gallantry, and above
all to behold these fair and honourable ladies and give
them especial thanks.</p>

<p>I am sure he would not have failed so to do, for he did
highly honour the said good and noble dames. Accordingly
he did write them, addressing chiefly the three chief
leaders, letters the most gracious possible, full of thanks
and compliments, the which did pleasure them greatly
and animate their courage to yet an higher pitch.</p>

<p>Alas! the truce came right enough some while after;
but meantime the city had been taken, as I have described
elsewhere. Truly ’twas an irreparable loss to France to
be deprived of so noble and affectionate an ally, which
mindful and conscious of the ties of its ancient origin,
was always fain to join us and take place in our ranks.
For they say these gallant Siennese be sprung from that
people of France which in Gaul they did call the Senones
in old times, now known as the folk of Sens. Moreover
they do retain to this day somewhat of the humour of us
Frenchmen; they do very much wear their heart on their
sleeve, as the saying is, and be quick, sudden and keen
like us. The Siennese ladies likewise have much of those
pretty ways and charming manners and graceful familiarities
which be the especial mark of Frenchwomen.</p>

<p>I have read in an old Chronicle, which I have cited
elsewhere, how King Charles VIII., on his Naples journey,
when he did come to Sienna, was there welcomed with
so magnificent and so triumphal an entry, as that it did
surpass all the others he received in all Italy. They did
even go so far by way of showing greater respect and as
a sign of humbleness, as to take all the city gates from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
off their hinges and lay the same flat on the ground;
and so long as he did tarry there, the gates were thus left
open and unguarded to all that came and went, then
after, on his departure, set up again as before.</p>

<p>I leave you to imagine if the King, and all his Court
and army, had not ample and sufficient cause to love and
honour this city (as indeed he did always), and to say all
possible good thereof. In fact their stay there was exceeding
agreeable to him and to all, and ’twas forbid
under penalty of death to offer any sort of insult, as
truly not the very smallest did ever occur. Ah! gallant
folk of Sienna, may ye live for ever! Would to heaven
ye were still ours in all else, as it may well be, ye are yet
in heart and soul! For the overrule of a King of France
is far gentler than that of a Duke of Florence; and besides
this, the kinship of blood can never go for naught.
If only we were as near neighbours as we be actually
remote from each other, we might very like be found at
one in will and deed.</p>

<p>In like wise the chiefest ladies of Pavia, at the siege
of that town by King Francis I. of France, following the
lead and example of the noble Countess Hippolita de
Malespina, their generalissima, did set them to carrying
of the earth-baskets, shifting soil and repairing the
breaches in their walls, vying with the soldiery in their
activity.</p>

<p>Conduct like that of the Siennese dames I have just
told of, myself did behold on the part of certain ladies
of <span class="no-wrap">La Rochelle,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span>
at the siege of their town. And I remember
me how on the first Sunday of Lent during the
siege, the King’s brother, our General, did summon M. de
la Noue to come before him on his parole, and speak with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
him and give account of the negotiations he had charged
him withal on behalf of the said city,—all the tale whereof
is long and most curious, as I do hope elsewhere to describe
the same. M. de la Noue failed not to appear, to which
end M. d’Estrozze was given as an hostage on the town,
and truce was made for that day and for the next
<span class="no-wrap">following.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27*]</a></span></p>

<p>This truce once concluded, there did appear immediately,
as on our side we too did show us outside our
trenches, many of the towns-folk on the ramparts and
walls. And notable over all were seen an hundred or so
of noble ladies and citizens’ wives and daughters, the
greatest, richest and fairest of all the town, all clad in
white, the dress, which did cover head as well as body,
being all of fine white Holland linen, that ’twas a very
fair sight to see. And they had adopted this dress by
reason of the fortification of the ramparts at which they
were at work, whether carrying of the earth-baskets or
moving the soil. Now other garments would have soon
grown foul, but these white ones had but to be sent to the
wash, and all was well again; beside, with this white costume
were they more readily distinguished among the
rest. For our part we were much delighted to behold these
fair ladies, and I do assure you many of us did find more
divertisement herein than in aught else. Nor were they
the least chary of giving us a sight of them, for they did
line the edge of the rampart, standing in a most gracious
and agreeable attitude, so as they were well worth our
looking at and longing after.</p>

<p>We were right curious to learn what ladies they were.
The towns-folk did inform us they were a company of
ladies so sworn and banded together, and so attired for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the work at the fortifications and for the performing
of suchlike services to their native city. And of a truth
did they do good service, even to the more virile and stalwart
of them bearing arms. Yea! I have heard it told
of one, how, for having oft repulsed her foes with a pike,
she doth to this day keep the same carefully as ’twere a
sacred relic, so that she would not part with it nor sell
it for much money, so dear a home treasure doth she
hold it.</p>

<p>I have heard the tale told by sundry old Knights Commanders
of Rhodes, and have even read the same in an
old book, how that, when Rhodes was besieged by Sultan
Soliman, the fair dames and damsels of that place did in
no wise spare their fair faces and tender and delicate
bodies, for to bear their full share of the hardships and
fatigues of the siege, but would even come forward many
a time at the most hot and dangerous attacks, and gallantly
second the knights and soldiery to bear up against
the same. Ah! fair Rhodian maids, your name and fame
is for all time; and ill did you deserve to be now fallen
under the rule of infidel <span class="no-wrap">barbarians!<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28*]</a></span>
In the reign of our
good King Francis I., the town of Saint-Riquier in
Picardy was attempted and assailed by a Flemish gentleman,
named Domrin, Ensign of M. du Ru, accompanied
by two hundred men at arms and two thousand foot folk,
beside some artillery. Inside the place were but an hundred
foot men, the which was far too few for defence.
It had for sure been captured, but that the women of the
town did appear on the walls with arms in hand, boiling
water and oil and stones, and did gallantly repulse the
foe, albeit these did exert every effort to gain an entry.
Furthermore two of the said brave ladies did wrest a pair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
of standards from the hands of the enemy, and bore them
from the walls into the town, the end of all being that the
besiegers were constrained to abandon the breach they
had made and the walls altogether, and make off and retire.
The fame of this exploit did spread through all
France, Flanders and Burgundy; while King Francis,
passing by the place some time after, was fain to see the
women concerned, and did praise and thank them for
their deed.</p>

<p>The ladies of Péronne[29] did in like gallant wise, when
that town was besieged by the Comte de Nassau, and did
aid the brave soldiers which were in the place in the same
fashion as their sisters of Saint-Riquier, for which they
were esteemed, commended and thanked of their sovereign.</p>

<p>The women of Sancerre[29] again, in the late civil wars
and during the siege of their town, were admired and
praised for the noble deeds they did at that time in all
sorts.</p>

<p>Also, during the War of the League, the dames of
<span class="no-wrap">Vitré<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span>
did acquit them right well in similar wise at the
besieging of the town by M. de Mercueur. The women
there be very fair and always right daintily put on, and
have ever been so from old time; yet did they not spare
their beauty for to show themselves manlike and
courageous. And surely all manly and brave-hearted
deeds, at such a time of need, are as highly to be esteemed
in women as in men.</p>

<p>Of the same gallant sort were of yore the women of
Carthage, who whenas they beheld their husbands, brothers,
kinsfolk and the soldiery generally cease shooting at
the foe, for lack of strings to their bows, these being all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
worn out by dint of shooting all through the long and
terrible siege, and for the same cause no longer being
able to provide them with hemp, or flax, or silk, or aught
else wherewithal to make bow-strings, did resolve to cut
off their lovely tresses and fair, yellow locks, not sparing
this beauteous honour of their heads and chief adornment
of their beauty. Nay! with their own fair hands,
so white and delicate, they did twist and wind the same
and make it into bow-strings to supply the men of war.
And I leave you to imagine with what high courage and
mettle these would now stretch and bend their bows, shoot
their arrows and fight the foe, bearing as they did such
fine favours of the ladies.</p>

<p>We read in the History of <span class="no-wrap">Naples<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span>
how that great
Captain Sforza, serving under the orders of Queen
Jeanne II., having been taken prisoner by the Queen’s
husband, James, and set in strict confinement and having
some taste of the strappado, would without a doubt
ere much longer have had his head cut off, but that his
sister did fly to arms and straight take the field. She
made so good a fight, she in her own person, as that she
did capture four of the chiefest Neapolitan gentlemen,
and this done, sent to tell the King that whatsoever treatment
he should deal to her brother, the same would she
meet out to his friends. The end was, he was constrained
to make peace and deliver him up safe and sound. Ah!
brave and gallant-hearted sister, rising so superior to her
sex’s weakness!</p>

<p>I do know of certain sisters and kinswomen, who if but
they had dared a like deed, some while agone, might mayhap
have saved alive a gallant brother of theirs, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
was undone for lack of help and timely succour of the
sort.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Now</span> am I fain to have done with the consideration
of these warlike and great-hearted dames
in general, and to speak of some particular
instances of the same. And as the fairest
example Antiquity hath to show us, I will adduce the
gallant Zenobia[31] only, to answer for all. This Queen,
after the death of her husband, was too wise to waste
her time, like so many others in like case, in mere lamentation
and vain regrets, but did grasp the reins of his
empire in the name of her children, and make war against
the Romans and their Emperor <span class="no-wrap">Aurelian,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span>
at that time
reigning at Rome. Much trouble did she give these foes
for eight long years, till at the last coming to a pitched
battle with his legions, she was vanquished therein and
taken prisoner and brought before the Emperor. On his
asking her how she had had the hardihood to make war
against the Emperors of Rome, she did answer only this:
“Verily! I do well recognise that you are Emperor, seeing
that you have vanquished me.”</p>

<p>So great content had he of his victory, and so proud
thereof was he and exalted, that he was fain to hold a
triumph over her. So with an exceeding great pomp and
magnificence did she walk before his triumphal car, right
gorgeously put on and adorned with much wealth of
pearls and precious stones, superb jewels and great
chains of gold, wherewith she was bound about the body
and by the hands and feet, in sign of being captive and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
slave of her conqueror. And so it was that by reason
of the heavy weight of her jewels and chains she was constrained
to make sundry pauses and to rest her again and
again on this march of triumph. A fine thing, of a
surety, and an admirable, that all vanquished and prisoner
as she was, she could yet give the law to her triumphant
conqueror, and thus make him tarry and wait her
pleasure till that she had recovered breath! A great instance
too of good feeling and honest courtesy on the
part of the Emperor, so to allow her breathing space
and rest, and to suffer her weakness, rather than unduly
to constrain or press her to hurry more than she well
could. So that one doth scarce know which to commend
the more, the honourable courtesy of the Emperor, or the
Queen’s way of acting,—who it may well be, did play
this part of set purpose, not so much forced thereto
by her actual weakness of body and weariness, as for to
make some show of pride and prove to all how she would
and could gather this little sprig of respect in the evening
of her fortunes no less than she had done in the
morning-tide of the same, and let them see how the Emperor
did grant her this much privilege, to wait on her
slow steps and lingering progress.</p>

<p>Much was the Queen gazed at and admired by men and
women alike, not a few of which last had been but too
glad to resemble so fair an apparition. For truly she
was one of the most lovely of women, by what is said
of the historians of these events. She was of a very fine,
tall and opulent figure, say they, her carriage right noble,
and her grace and dignity to match; furthermore her
face very beautiful and exceeding pleasing, her eyes dark
and piercing. Beside her other beauties, these writers do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
give her fine and very white teeth, a keen wit and a
modest bearing, a sincere and at need a kind and merciful
heart. Her speech was eloquent and spoke with a fine
clear voice; moreover she was used always to express her
ideas and wishes herself to her soldiers, and would many a
time harangue the same publicly.</p>

<p>I ween he did so show her to best advantage, thus
richly and gracefully attired in women’s weeds, no less
than when she was armed in all points as the Warrior
Queen. For sex doth always count for much; and we may
rightly suppose the Emperor was fain to display her at
his triumph only under guise of her own fair sex, wherein
she would seem most beauteous and agreeable to the populace
in all the perfection of her charms. Furthermore,
’tis to be supposed, so lovely as she was, the Emperor
had tasted and enjoyed her loveliness, and was yet in the
enjoyment thereof. So albeit he had vanquished her in
one fashion, yet had she,—or he, if you prefer it so, for
the two be as one in this,—won the victory in another.</p>

<p>Mine own wonder is, that seeing the said Zenobia was
so beautiful, the Emperor did not take her and keep
her for one of his mistresses; or else that she did not
open and establish by his permission, or the Senate’s, a
shop or market of love and harlotry, as did the fair
Flora in the same city, for to win wealth and store up
much gear and goods, by the toil of her body and shaking
of her bed. For to such a market had surely resorted
all the greatest men of Rome, one vying with other in
eagerness; seeing there is no contentment ’twould seem, or
satisfaction in all the world like that of a man’s taking his
will of a Royal or Princely person, and enjoying of a fair
Queen, or Princess or a high-born Lady. As to this I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
do appeal to such men as have embarked on these voyages,
and made such good traffic there. Now in this fashion
would Queen Zenobia have soon grown rich out of the
purse of these great folks, as did Flora, which did receive
no others in her place of commerce. Had it not been far
better for her to make of her life a scene of merry-making
and magnificence, of money getting and compliments,
than to have fallen into that need and extremity of poverty
she did come to? For she was constrained to gain
her bread a-spinning among common work-women, and
would have died of hunger, but that the Senate, taking
pity of her in view of her former greatness, did decree
her a pension for her maintenance, and some trifling
lands and possessions, which were for long after known
as “Zenobia’s Lands.” For indeed and indeed is poverty
a sore evil; and whosoever can avoid the same, no matter
what transformation be taken to that end, doth well and
right, as one I wot of was used to declare.</p>

<p>Thus we see how Zenobia did not carry her high courage
to the end of her career, as she should,—and as folk
should ever persist in every course of action to the last.
’Tis said she had had a triumphal car constructed, the
most magnificent ever seen in Rome, to the end she might,
as she was often used to say in her days of high prosperity
and glorying, hold triumph therein at Rome. For
her ambition was to conquer and subdue the Roman Empire!
Alas! for her presumption; for it did all fall out
quite otherwise, and the Emperor having won the day,
did take her car for himself, and use it in his own triumph,
while she did march a-foot, and did make as much triumph
and ceremonial over her as if he had vanquished a
puissant King,—and more. Yet be sure, a victory won<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
over a woman, be it gained how it may, is no very great
or famous exploit!</p>

<p>After a like fashion did Augustus long to triumph
over Cleopatra; but he got no success in this. She did
forestall him in good time, and in the same way which
Aemilius Paulus did signify in what he said to
<span class="no-wrap">Perseus,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span>
when in his captivity he did beseech him to have pity on
him, answering him he should have seen to that beforehand,
meaning that he ought to have killed himself.</p>

<p>I have heard say that our late King Henri II. did
long for no other thing so sore as to be able to take
prisoner the Queen of Hungary, and this not to treat her
ill, albeit she had given him many causes of offence by her
devastations of his territory, but only to have the glory
of holding this great Princess captive, and to see what
bearing and countenance she would show in her prison,
and if she would then be so gallant and proud-spirited
as at the head of her armies. For in truth there is
naught else so fine and gallant as such a fair, brave and
high-born lady, when she hath will and courage as had
this same Princess, which did much delight in the name
the Spanish soldiers had given her; for just as they did
call her brother the Emperor <i>el padre de los soldados</i>,
“the father of the soldiers,” so did they entitle her
<i>la madre</i>, “the mother,” of the same. So in old days,
in the times of the Romans, was Victoria or Victorina
known in her armies by the name of “the mother of the
camp.” Of a surety, an if a great and beautiful lady
do undertake an exploit of war, she doth contribute much
to its success and giveth much encouragement and spirit
to her folk, as myself have seen in the case of our own
Queen Mother, Catherine de Medici, which did often visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
our armies, and so doing did greatly animate their
courage and rouse their ardour. The same is done at
this present by her grand-daughter, the Infanta[33] in
Flanders, which doth take the lead of her army, and
show herself a valorous chief of her fighting men,—so
much so that without her and her noble and delightful
presence, Flanders could never have been retained, as
all men allow. And never did even the Queen of Hungary
herself, her grand-aunt, make so fair a show of beauty,
valour, great-heartedness and graceful bearing.</p>

<p>In our histories of France we do read of how much
avail was the presence of the noble-hearted Comtesse
<span class="no-wrap">de Montfort,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span>
when shut up and besieged in Hennebon. For
albeit her men were brave and valiant, and had quit themselves
in battle and withstood the enemy’s assaults as well
as ever any folk could, yet did they at the last begin to
lose heart and talk of surrendering. But she did harangue
them so eloquently, and did re-animate their courage
with such good and intrepid words, inspiriting them so
finely and so well, as that they did hold out till the
succour, so long and eagerly desired, did arrive, and the
siege was raised. Nay! she did better still; for whenas
the enemy were set on the attack and were all busied
therewith, seeing their tents to be all left empty and
unprotected, she did make a sally, mounted on a good
horse and with fifty good horses to follow her. In this
wise doth she surprise the camp and set it a-fire, the
result being that Charles de Blois, deeming himself to be
betrayed, did straight abandon the assault. On this subject,
I will add yet another little tale:</p>

<p>During the late Wars of the League, the Prince de
Condé, since deceased, being at Saint-Jean, did send to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
demand of Madame <span class="no-wrap">de Bourdeille,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span>
then a widow of the
age of forty, and a very handsome woman, six or seven
of the wealthiest tenants of her estate, the which had
taken refuge in her castle of Mathas at her side. She did
refuse him outright, declaring she would never betray
nor give up these unhappy folk, who had put themselves
under her protection and trusted to her honour for their
safety. On this he did summon her for the last time,
informing her that unless she would deliver them up to
him, he would teach her better obedience. She did make
reply to this (for myself was with her by way of rendering
help) that, seeing he knew not himself how to obey,
she did find it very strange he should wish to make others
do so, and that so soon as he should have obeyed his
King’s orders, she would obey him. For the rest, she did
declare that for all his threats, she was afraid neither
of his cannon nor of his siege, and how that she was
descended from the far-famed Comtesse de Montfort,
from whom her folk had inherited the place, and herself
too, and therewith some share of her gallantry. Further
that she was determined to defend the same so well as
that he should never take it, and that she should win no
less fame herein than her ancestress, the aforesaid Countess,
had done at Hennebon. The Prince did ponder long
over this reply, and did delay some days’ space, without
further threatening her. Yet, had he not presently died,
he would assuredly have laid siege to her castle; but in
that case was she right well prepared in heart, resolution,
men and gear, to receive him warmly, and I do think he
would have gotten a shameful rebuff.</p>

<p>Machiavelli, in his book <i>On the Art of War</i>, doth
relate how that Catherine, Countess of Forli, was besieged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
in that her good town fortress by Cæsar Borgia,
aided by the French army, which did make a most gallant
resistance to him, yet at the last was taken. The cause
of its loss was this, that the said strong town was over
full of fortresses and strongholds, for folk to retire from
the one to the other; so much so that Borgia having made
his approaches, the Signor Giovanni de Casale (whom the
said Countess had chose for her helper and protector),
did abandon the breach to withdraw into his strongholds.
Through the which error, Borgia did force an entrance
and took the place. And so, saith the author, these
errors did much wrong the high-hearted courage and repute
of the said gallant Countess, which had withstood
an army the King of Naples and the Duke of Milan had
not dared to face; and albeit the issue was unfortunate,
yet did she win the honour she so well deserved, and for
this exploit many rhymes and verses were writ in Italy
in her honour. This passage is one well worthy the attention
of all such as have to do with the fortifying of
places of strength, and do set them to build therein great
numbers of castles, strongholds, fortresses and citadels.</p>

<p>To return to our proper subject, we have had in times
past many Princesses and high-born ladies in this our
land of France, which have given excellent marks of their
prowess. As did <span class="no-wrap">Paule,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35*]</a></span>
daughter of the Comte de Penthièvre,
who was besieged in Roye by the Comte de Charolais,
and did there show herself so gallant and great-hearted
as that, on the town being taken, the Count did
grant her very good conditions, and had her conducted
in safety to Compiègne, not suffering any hurt to be done
her. So greatly did he honour her for her valour,—and
this albeit he felt deep resentment against her husband,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
whom he held guilty of having tried to work his death
by black arts and sundry evil devices of images and
candles.</p>

<p>Richilda,[36] only daughter and heiress of Mons in Hainault,
and wife of Baldwyn the Sixth, Count of Flanders,
did make all efforts against Robert the Frisian, her
brother-in-law, appointed guardian of the children of
Flanders, for to take away from him the duty and administration
of the same, and have it assigned to herself.
To which end she did take up arms with the help of
Philip, King of France, and hazarded two battles[36] against
Count Robert. In the first she was taken prisoner, as
was likewise her foe, the said Count Robert, but afterward
were the twain given back in exchange one of the
other. A second battle followed, which she lost, her son
Arnulphe being slain therein, and was driven back to
Mons.</p>

<p>Ysabel of France, daughter of King Philippe le Bel,
and wife of <span class="no-wrap">Edward II.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>
of England, and Duke of
Guienne, was ill looked on of the King her husband,
through the intrigues of Hugh le Despenser, whereby she
was constrained to withdraw to France with her son
Edward. Afterward she did return to England with the
Chevalier de Hainault, her kinsman, and an army which
she did lead thither, and by means of which she did presently
take her husband prisoner. Him she did deliver
up into the hands of men which did soon bring about his
death; a fate that overtook herself likewise, for by reason
of her loves with a certain Lord Mortimer, she was confined
by her own son in a castle, and there ended her
days. She it was that did afford the English pretext
to quarrel with France to the sore hurt of the same.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Yet surely we have here a piece of base ingratitude on
her son’s part, who all forgetful of great benefit received,
did so cruelly treat his mother for so small a fault.
Small I call it, for that ’twas but natural, and an easy
thing, that after dealing long with men of arms, and
grown so accustomed to go in manly guise with them amid
armies and tents and camps, she should do the like also
a-bed.</p>

<p>This is a thing oft times seen to happen. For example
I do refer me to our Queen <span class="no-wrap">Léonor,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37*]</a></span>
Duchess of Guienne,
which did accompany her husband over seas and to the
Holy Wars. By dint of much frequenting of men at
arms and troopers and such folk, she did come to derogate
very gravely from her honour,—so far as that she
did have dealings even with the Saracens. For the which
the King her husband did put her away, a thing that
cost us very dear. We can but suppose she was fain to
try whether these worthy foes were as gallant champions
in a lady’s chamber as in the open field, and that mayhap
’twas her humour to ever love valiant wights, and that
one valiance doth ever attract another, as virtue doth
to virtue. For verily he saith most true, which doth
declare virtue to be like the lightning, that pierceth
through all things.</p>

<p>The said Queen Léonor was not the only lady which
did accompany her husband to these same Holy Wars.
But both before her day, and with her, and after her, no
few other Princesses and great ladies did along with their
lords take the cross,—not that they did therefore cross
their legs, but did rather open these and stretch them
right wide, in such wise that while some did remain there
for good and all, others came back from the wars most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
finished harlots. So under pretext of visiting the Holy
Sepulchre, amid all that press of arms they did much
amorous wantoning; for verily, as I have observed afore,
arms and love do well accord together, so close and congruous
is the sympathy betwixt these twain.</p>

<p>Suchlike dames ought surely to be esteemed, loved and
treated like men,—not as the Amazons did of old, which
proclaiming themselves daughters of Mars, did rid them
of their husbands, pretending marriage was sheer slavery;
yet desire enough and to spare had they to go with other
men, for to have daughters of them, but killing all the
male children.</p>

<p>Jo. Nauclerus, in his <span class="no-wrap"><i>Cosmography</i>,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38*]</a></span>
relates how, in the
year of Christ 1123, after the death of Tibussa, Queen
of the Bohemians, she who did first close in the town of
Prague with walls, and who did very greatly abhor the
power and domination of men, there was one of her damsels,
by name Valasca, which did so well gain over the
maids and matrons of that land by her fair and alluring
promises of liberty, and did so thoroughly disgust and
set them against their servitude to manfolk, as that they
did slay each her man, one her husband, another her
brother, another her kinsman or next neighbour, and so
in less than no time were mistresses of the realm. Then
having taken their husbands’ harness of war, they did
make such good use thereof, and grew so valiant and
skilled in arms, fighting after the Amazon fashion, as
that they soon gat them several victories. Yet were they
presently, by the conduct and cunning wiles of one Primislaus,
husband of Tibussa, a man she had raised up from
low and humble state, routed entirely and put to death.
This was sure God Almighty’s vengeance for so heinous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
an act and dread attempt, no less indeed than to destroy
the human race itself.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Thus</span> did these Amazonian dames find no other
fashion of showing forth their gallant spirit
for fine, bold and manly exploits but only
by these cruel deeds we have named. On the
contrary, how many Empresses, Queens, Princesses and
other high-born Ladies, have done the like by means of
noble acts, both in the governance and management of
their dominions, and in other excellent ways, whereof the
Histories be so full that I need not recount the same.
For the desire of holding sway, of reigning and ruling,
doth lodge within women’s breasts no less than in men’s,
and they be just as eager after domination as the other
sex.</p>

<p>Well! now I am about to speak of one that was unsullied
of this ambition, to wit Vittoria <span class="no-wrap">Colonna,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span>
wife of the Marquis de Pescaire. I have read of this lady in a
Spanish book, how that whenas the said Marquis did
hearken to the fine offers made him by Hieronimo Mouron
on the Pope’s behalf (as I have said in a previous passage)
of the Kingdom of Naples, if only he would enter
into the league with him, she being informed of the matter
by her husband himself, who did never hide aught from
her of his privy affairs, neither small nor great, did write
to him (for she had an excellent gift of language), and
bade him remember his ancient valour and virtue, the
which had given him such glory and high repute, as that
these did exceed the fame and fortune of the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Kings of the earth. She then went on: <i>non con grandeza
de los reynos, de Estados ny de hermosos titulos, sino
con fè illustre y clara virtud, se alcançava la honra, la
qual con loor siempre vivo, legava a los descendientes; y
que no havia ningun grado tan alto que no fuese vencido
de una trahicion y mala fe. Que por esto, ningun deseo
tenia de ser muger de rey, queriendo antes ser muger de
tal capitan, que no solamente en guerra con valorosa
mano, mas en paz con gran honra de animo no vencido,
havia sabido vencer reyes, y grandissimos principes, y
capitanes, y darlos a triunfos, y imperiarlos</i>,—“not by
the greatness of Kingdoms and of vast Dominions, nor
yet of high and sounding titles, but by fair faith and
unsullied virtue, is honour won,—the virtue that with
ever living praise doth go down to all descendants. And
there is never a rank so exalted but it were undone and
spoiled by treason wrought and good faith broke. For
such a prize she had no wish to be a King’s wife, but had
rather be a simple Captain’s such as he, which not alone
in war by his valiant arm, but in peace likewise with the
honour of an unbroken spirit, had been strong to vanquish
Kings, great Princes and mighty Captains, to triumph
over the same and master them.” High courage and
virtue and truth did all mark this lady’s words; for truly
to reign by ill faith is a very evil and sorry thing, but
to give the law to Kings and kingdoms by honesty and
worth a right noble one.</p>

<p>Fulvia, wife of Publius Clodius, and in second wedlock
that of Mark Antony, finding but small amusement in
her household tasks, did set herself to higher business,
to manage affairs of State that is, till she did win herself
the repute of ruling the Rulers of <span class="no-wrap">Rome.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40*]</a></span>
And indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Cleopatra did owe her some gratitude and obligation for
having so well trained and disciplined Mark Antony to
obey and bend him under the laws of submission.</p>

<p>We read moreover of that great French Prince Charles
Martel, which in his day would never take nor bear the
title of King, as ’twas within his power to do, but liked
better to govern Kings and give orders to the same.</p>

<p>However let us speak of some of our own countrywomen.
We had, in our War of the League, Madame de
Montpensier, sister of the late Duc de Guise, who was a
great Stateswoman, and did contribute much, as well by
the subtile inventions of her fine spirit as by the labour of
her hands, to build up the said league. And after the
same had been now well established, playing one day at
cards (for she doth well love this pastime) and taking
the first deal, on their telling her she should well shuffle
the cards, she did answer before all the company: “I have
shuffled the cards so well, as that they could not be
better shuffled or combined together.” This would all
have turned out well, if only her friends had lived; on
whose unhappy end however, without losing heart at all
at such a loss, she did set herself to avenge them. And
having heard the news when in Paris, she doth not shut
herself in her chamber to indulge her grief, as most other
women would have done, but cometh forth of her house
with her brother’s children, and holding these by the
hand, doth take them up and down the city, making
public mourning of her bereavement before the citizens,
rousing the same by her tears and piteous cries and sad
words which she did utter to all, to take up arms and
rise in fierce protest, and insult the
<span class="no-wrap">King’s<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>
house and
picture, as we have seen done, and I do hope to relate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
in his life, and deny all fealty to him, swearing rank
rebellion to his authority, all which did presently result
in his murder. As to which ’tis well enough known what
persons, men and women, did counsel the same, and are
properly guilty thereof. Of a surety no sister’s heart,
losing such brothers, could well digest such deadly venom
without vengeance of this foul murder.</p>

<p>I have heard it related how after she had thus put the
good folk of Paris in so great a state of animosity and
dissatisfaction, she did set her forth to ask of the Duke
of Parma his help toward her vengeance. So thither she
maketh her way, but by such long and heavy stages as
that her coach horses were left so wearied out and
foundered, stranded in the mire somewhere in the very
midst of Picardy, that they could not go another step
either forward or backward, nor put one foot before
another. As chance would have it, there did pass that
way a very honourable gentleman of that countryside,
which was a Protestant, and who, albeit she was disguised
both as to name and in dress, did recognize her
well enough. But yet, ignoring all the hurts she had
wrought against his fellows in religion, and the hatred
she bare them, with frank and full courtesy, he did thus
accost her: “Madam, I know you well, and am your most
humble servant. I find you in ill case, and beg you, an
if you will, come to my house, which is close at hand,
to dry your clothes and rest you. I will afford you every
convenience I can to the very best of my ability. Have
no fear; for though I be of the reformed faith, which
you do hate so sore in us, I would fain not leave you
without offering you a courtesy you do stand much in
need of.” This fair offer she did in no wise refuse, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
did accept very readily; then after that he had provided
her with such things as were needful, she doth take the
road again, he conducting her on her way two leagues,
though all the while she did keep secret from him the
purport of her journey. Later on in the course of the
war, by what I have heard, she did repay her debt to the
said gentleman by many acts of courtesy done him.</p>

<p>Many have wondered at her trusting of herself to him,
being Huguenot as he was. But there! necessity hath no
law; and beside, she did see him so honourable seeming,
and heard him speak so honestly and frankly, that she
could not but believe him disposed to deal fairly with her.</p>

<p>As for Madame de Nemours, her mother, who was
thrown into prison after the murder of her noble son’s
children, there can be little doubt of the despair and
desolation she was left in by so intolerable a loss; and
albeit till that day she had ever shown herself of a gentle
and cold humour, and one that did need good and sufficient
cause to rouse her, she did now spew forth a
thousand insults against the King, and cast in his teeth
a thousand curses and execrations, going so far (for
verily what deed or word could ever match the vehemence
of such a loss and bitter sorrow?) as always to speak of
him by no other name but this, <i>that Tyrant</i>. Later,
being come somewhat to herself, she would say: “Alas!
what say I,—Tyrant? Nay! nay! I will not call him so,
but a most good and clement King, if only he will kill me
as he hath killed my children, to take me out of the
wretchedness wherein I am, and remove me to the blessedness
of God’s heaven!” Later again, softening still further
her words and bitter cries, and finding some surcease
of sorrow, she would say naught else but only, “Ah! my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
children! my poor children!”—repeating these same
words over and over again with floods of tears, that
’twould have melted an heart of stone. Alas! she might
well lament and deplore them so sore, being so good and
great hearted, so virtuous and so valorous, as they were,
but above all the noble Duc de Guise, a worthy eldest
son and true paragon of all valour and true-heartedness.
Moreover she did love her children so fondly, that one
day as I was discoursing with a noble lady of the Court
of the said Madame de Nemours, she told me how that
Princess was the happiest in all the world, for sundry
reasons which she did give me,—except only in one thing,
which was that she did love her children over much; for
that she did love them with such excess of fondness as
that the common anxiety she had of their safety and the
fear some ill should happen them, did cloud all her
happiness, making her to live always in inquietude and
alarm for their sake. I leave you then, reader, to imagine
how grievous was the sorrow, bitterness and pain she
did feel at the death of these twain, and how lively the
terror for the <span class="no-wrap">other,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42*]</a></span>
which was away in the neighbourhood
of Lyons, as well as for the Duke her husband,
then a prisoner. For of his imprisonment she had never
a suspicion, as herself did declare, nor of his death
neither, as I have said above.</p>

<p>When she was removed from the Castle of Blois to be
conveyed to that of Amboise for straiter confinement
therein, just as she had passed the gate, she did turn
her round and lifted her head toward the figure of King
Louis XII., her grandfather, which is there carven in
stone above the door, on horseback and with a very
noble mien and warlike bearing. So she, tarrying there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
a little space and gazing thereon, said in a loud voice
before a great number of folk which had come together,
with a fine bold look which did never desert her: “An if
he which is there pourtrayed were alive, he would never
suffer his granddaughter thus to be carried away prisoner,
and treated as she is this day.” Then with these
words, she did go on her way, without further remonstrance.
Understand this, that in her heart she was
invoking and making appeal to the manes of that her
great-hearted ancestor, to avenge her of the injustice
of her imprisonment. Herein she acted precisely as did
certain of the conspirators for Cæsar’s death, which as
they were about to strike their blow, did turn them
toward the statue of Pompey, and did inwardly invoke
and make appeal to the shade of his valiant arm, so
puissant of old, to conduct the emprise they were set on to
a successful issue. It may well be the invocation of this
Princess may have something aided and advanced the
death of the King which had so outraged her. A lady
of high heart and spirit which doth thus brood over
vengeance to come is no little to be dreaded.</p>

<p>I do remember me how, when her late husband, the
Duc de Guise, did get the stroke whereof he died, she
was at the time in his camp, having come thither some
days previously to visit the same. So soon as ever he
did come into his quarters wounded, she did advance to
meet him as far as the door of his lodging all tearful
and despairing, and after saluting him, did suddenly
cry out: “Can it be that the wretch which hath struck
this blow and he that hath set him on (signifying her
suspicion of the Admiral de Coligny) should go unpunished?
Oh God! an if thou art just, as thou must needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
be, avenge this deed; or else ...,” but stopping at
this word, she did not end her sentence, for that her
noble husband did interrupt her, saying: “Nay! dear
heart, defy not God. An if ’tis He which hath sent me
this for my sins, His will be done, and we should glorify
him therefor. But an if it come from other, seeing vengeance
is His alone, He will surely exact the penalty
without you.” Natheless, when he was dead, did she so
fiercely follow up her revenge, as that the murderer was
torn to pieces of four <span class="no-wrap">horses,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43*]</a></span>
while the supposed author
of the crime was assassinated after the lapse of some
years, as I will tell in its proper place. This was due to
the instruction she did give her son, as myself have seen,
and the counsel and persuasion she did feed him withal
from his tenderest years, till at the last final and complete
vengeance was accomplished.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> counsel and appeal of great-hearted wives
and loving mothers be of no small avail in
such matters. As to this, I do remember me
how, when King Charles IX. was making his
Royal progress about his Kingdom, and was now at
Bordeaux, the Baron de Bournazel was put in prison,
a very brave and honourable gentleman of Gascony, for
having slain another gentleman of his own neighbourhood,
named La Tour,—and, so ’twas said, by dint of much
traitorous subtlety. The widow did so eagerly press for
his punishment, as that care was taken the news should
reach the King’s and Queen’s chambers, that they were
about to cut off the said Baron’s head. Hereon did the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
gentlemen and ladies of the Court of a sudden bestir
themselves, and much effort was made to save his life.
Twice over were the King and Queen besought to grant
his pardon. The High Chancellor did set him strongly
against this, saying justice must needs be done; whereas
the King was much in favour of mercy, for that he was
a young man, and asked for naught better than to save
his life, as he was one of the gallants frequenting the
Court, and M. de <span class="no-wrap">Cipierre<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span>
was keen in urging the same
course. Yet was the hour of execution now drawing nigh,
without aught being done,—to the astonishment of everybody.</p>

<p>Hereupon did M. de Nemours intervene, which loved
the unhappy Baron, who had followed him gallantly on
sundry fields of battle. The Duke went and threw himself
at the Queen’s feet, and did earnestly beseech her
to give the poor gentleman his life, begging and praying
so hard and pressing her so with his words as that
the favour was e’en given him at the last. Then on the
instant was sent a Captain of the Guard, which went and
sought the man out and took him from the prison, just
as he was being led forth to his doom. Thus was he
saved, but in such fearful circumstances that a look of
terror did remain ever after imprinted on his features,
and he could never thereafter regain his colour, as myself
have seen. I have heard tell how the same thing did
happen to M. de Saint-Vallier, which did have a fine
escape by the interest of M. de Bourbon.</p>

<p>Meantime however the widow was not idle, but did
come next day to intercept the King as he was going to
Mass, and did throw herself at his feet. She did present
him her son, which might be three or four years old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
saying thus: “At the least, Sire, as you have given pardon
to this child’s murderer, I do beseech you grant the same
to him now at this moment, for the time when he shall
be grown up and shall have taken his vengeance and
slain that wretch.” And from that time onward, by what
I have heard said, the mother would come every morning
to awake her child; and showing him the bloody shirt his
father had on when he was killed, would repeat to him
three times over: “Mark this token, well, and bear well
in mind, when you be grown up, to avenge this wrong;
else do I disinherit you.” A bitter spirit of revenge
truly!</p>

<p>Myself when I was in Spain, did hear the tale how
Antonio Roques, one of the most brave and valiant, cunning,
cautious and skilful, famous and withal most courteous,
bandits ever was in all Spain (’tis a matter of
common knowledge), did in his early years desire to enter
religion and be ordained priest. But the day being now
come when he was to sing his first mass, just as he was
coming forth from the vestry and was stepping with great
ceremony toward the High Altar of his parish Church
duly robed and accoutred to do his office, and chalice in
hand, he did hear his mother saying to him as he passed
her: <i>Ah! vellaco, vellaco, mejor seria de vengar la muerte
de tu padre, que de cantar misa</i>,—“Ah! wretch and miscreant
that you are! ’twere better far to avenge your
father’s death than to be singing Mass.” This word did
so touch him at heart, as that he doth coldly turn him
about in mid progress, and back to the vestry, where he
doth unrobe him, pretending his heart had failed him
from indisposition, and that it should be for another
time. Then off to the mountains to join the brigands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
among whom he doth presently win such esteem and renown
that he was chose their chief; there he doth many
crimes and thefts, and avengeth his father’s death, which
had been killed, some said, of a comrade, though others
declared him a victim of the King’s justice. This tale
was told me by one that was a bandit himself, and had
been under his orders in former days. This man did bepraise
him to the third heaven; and true it is the Emperor
Charles could never do him any hurt.</p>

<p>But to return once more to Madame de Nemours, the
King did keep her in prison scarce any time, whereof was
M. d’Escars in part the cause. He did soon release her,
for to send her on a mission to the Ducs du Maine and
de Nemours, and other Princes members of the League,
bearing to all words of peace and oblivion of all past
grievances:—dead men were dead, and there an end; best
be good friends as aforetime. In fact, the King did take
an oath of her, that she would faithfully perform this
said embassy. Accordingly on her arrival, at first accost
’twas naught but tears and lamentations and regrets for
all their losses; then anon did she make report of her
instructions, whereto M. du Maine did reply, asking her
if this were her own advice. She answered simply: “I
have not come hither, my son, to advise you, but only to
repeat to you the message I am charged withal and bidden
give you. ’Tis for you to think whether you have sufficient
cause to do so, and if your duty points that way.
As to what I tell you, your heart and your conscience
should give you the best advice. For myself, I do but
discharge a commission I have promised to fulfil.” Natheless,
under the rose, she knew well enough how to stir the
fire, which did long burn so fierce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p>Many folks have wondered greatly, how the King, that
was so wise and one of the most adroit men of his Kingdom,
came to employ this lady for such an office, having
so sorely injured her that she could have had neither
heart nor feeling if she had taken therein the very least
pains in the world; but there, she did simply make mock
of him and his instructions. Report said at the time this
was the fine advice of the Maréchal de Retz, who did give
a like piece of counsel to King Charles, namely to send
M. de la Noue into the town of La Rochelle, for to persuade
the inhabitants to peace and their proper duty and
allegiance. The better to accredit him to them, he did
permit him to play the eager partisan on their side and
on his own, to fight desperately for them, and give them
counsel and advice against the King,—but all under this
condition that when his services should be claimed by the
King or the King’s brother, which was his Lieutenant
General, and he ordered to leave the place, he would
obey. This he did and all else, making fierce enough
war, and finally quitting the place; yet meanwhile he did
so confirm his folk and sharpen their spirit, and did give
them such excellent lessons and so greatly encouraged
them, as that for that time they did cut our beards to
rights for <span class="no-wrap">us.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45*]</a></span>
Many would have it, there was no subtlety
in all this; but I did see it all with mine own eyes, and I
do hope to give full account of these doings elsewhere.
At any rate this was all the said Maréchal did avail his
King and country; one that ’twere more natural surely
to hold a charlatan and swindler than a good counsellor
and a Marshal of France.</p>

<p>I will tell one other little word of the aforesaid Duchesse
de Nemours. I have heard it said that at the time they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
were framing the famous League, and she would be examining
the papers and the lists of the towns which did
join it, not yet seeing Paris figuring therein, she would
ever say to her son: “All this is naught, my son; we must
have Paris to boot. If you have not Paris, you have
done naught; wherefore, ho! for Paris city.” And never
a word but Paris, Paris, was always in her mouth; and
the end of it all was the barricades that were seen afterward.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> this we see how a brave heart doth ever fly at
the highest game. And this doth again remind
me of a little tale I have read in a Spanish Romance
called <i>la Conquista de Navarra</i>, “The
Conquest of <span class="no-wrap">Navarre.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span>
This Kingdom having been taken
and usurped from King John of Navarre by the King of
Aragon, Louis XII. did send an army under M. de la
Palice to win it back. Our King did send word to the
Queen, Donna Catherine, by M. de la Palice which did
bring her the news, that she should come to the Court
of France and there tarry with his Queen Anne, while
that the King, her husband, along with M. de la Palice
was making essay to recover the Kingdom. The Queen
did make him this gallant answer: “How now, Sir! I
did suppose the King your master had sent you hither
for to carry me with you to my Kingdom and set me again
at Pampeluna, and for me to accompany you thither, as
my mind was made up to do and my preparations made.
Yet now you bid me go stay at the Court of France?
Truly a poor hope and ill augury for me! I see plainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
I shall never set foot in mine own land again.” And even
as she did presage, the thing fell out.</p>

<p>It was told and commanded the Duchess de Valentinois,
on the approach of the death of King Henri II., when his
health was now despaired of, to retire to her mansion in
Paris, and go no more into his chamber,—to the end she
might not disturb him in his pious meditations, and no
less on account of the hostility certain did bear her. Then
when she had so withdrawn, they did send to her again to
demand sundry rings and jewels, which did belong to the
Crown and which she must give back. At this she did
on a sudden ask the worthy spokesman: “Why! is the
King dead then?”—“No! Madam,” replied the other, “but
it can scarce be long first.”—“As long as there is one
breath of life left in his body, I would have my enemies
to know I fear them not a whit, and that I will never
obey them, so long as he shall be alive. My courage is
still invincible. But when he is dead, I care not to live
on after him, and all the vexations you could inflict on
me would be but kindness compared with the bitterness
of my loss. So, whether my King be quick or dead, I fear
not mine enemies at all.”</p>

<p>Herein did this fair lady show great spirit, and a true
heart. Yet she did not die, ’twill be objected of some, as
she did say she would. True! yet did she not fail to experience
some threatenings of death; beside, she did better
to choose rather to live than to die, for to show her
enemies she was no wise afeared of them. Having erst
seen them shake and tremble before her, she would fain
escape doing the same before them, and did wish to show
so good a face and confident look to them as that they
never durst do her any displeasure. Nay! more than this;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
within two years’ space they did seek to her more than
ever, and renewed their friendship with her, as I did
myself see. And this is the way with great lords and
ladies, which have little solid continuance in their friendships,
and in their differences do readily make it up
again, like thieves at a fair, and the same with all their
loves and hatreds. This we smaller folks do never do; for
either we must needs fight, avenge and die, or else make up
the quarrel by way of punctilious, minutely ordered and
carefully arranged terms of agreement. So in this we do
play the better part.</p>

<p>We cannot but admire this lady’s conduct and behaviour;
and truly these high-born dames which have
to do with affairs of State, do commonly act in a grander
way than the ordinary run of women. And this is why
our late King Henri III., last deceased, and the Queen,
his mother, did by no means love such ladies of their Court
as did much trouble their wits with matters of State and
put their nose therein and did concern them to speak of
other matters near touching the government of the Kingdom.
’Twas as if, their Majesties were used to declare,
they had some great part therein and might be heirs of the
same, or just as if they had given the sweat of their bodies
and force of their hands to its management and maintenance,
like men; whereas, for a mere pastime, talking at
the fireside, sitting comfortably in their chairs or lying on
their pillows, or their daybeds, they would discourse at
their ease of the world at large and the state of the
Country, as if they did arrange it all. On this point a
certain great lady of fashion, whom I will not name, did
one time make a shrewd reply, who taking on her to say
out all her say on occasion of the first meeting of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Estates at Blois, their Majesties did cause a slight reprimand
to be given her, telling her she should attend to
the affairs of her own house and her prayers to God.
To this being something too free in her speech, she did
answer thus: “In days of yore when Princes, Kings and
great Lords did take the cross and hie them over-seas, to
do so noble exploits in the Holy Land, insooth ’twas allowed
us women only to fast and pray, make orisons and
vows, that God might give them a successful journey and
a safe return. But nowadays that we do see them do
naught better than ourselves, ’tis surely allowed us to
speak of all matters; for as to praying God for them,
why should we do so, seeing they do no more heroic deeds
than ourselves?”</p>

<p>This speech was for sure too bold and outspoken, and
indeed it came very nigh to costing her dear. She had all
the difficulty in the world to win pardon and excuse, which
she had to ask for right humbly; and had it not been for
a certain private reason I could tell, and if I would, she
had received dire pains and penalties therefor, and very
signal punishment.</p>

<p>’Tis not always well to speak out a sharp saying such
as this, when it cometh to the lips. Myself have seen not
a few folk which could in no wise govern their wit in this
sort, but were more untamed than a Barbary charger.
Finding a good shrewd gibe in their mouth, out they must
spit it, without sparing relations, friends or superiors.
Many such I have known at our own Court of France,
where they were well called <i>Marquis et Marquises de belle-bouche</i>,
“Lords and Ladies of Frank Speech;” but many
and many a time did their frank speech bring them in sore
trouble.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Having</span> thus described the brave and gallant
bearing of sundry ladies on sundry noble
occasions of their life, I am fain now to give
some examples of the like high qualities displayed
at their death. Without borrowing any instance
of Antiquity, I will merely adduce that of the late deceased
Queen <span class="no-wrap">Regent<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span>
mother of our noble King Francis
I. In her day this Princess, as I have heard many of
mine acquaintance say, both men and women, was a very
fair lady, and very gay and gallant to boot, which she
did continue to be even in her declining years. And for
this cause, when folk did talk to her of death, she
did exceedingly mislike such discourse, not excepting
preachers which did hold forth on this subject in their
sermons. “As if,” she would cry, “we did not all of us
know well enough we must one day die. The fact is,
these preachers, whenas they can find naught further to
say in their sermons, and be at the end of their powers
of invention, like other simple folk, do take refuge in this
theme of death.” The late Queen of Navarre, her daughter,
did no less than her mother detest these same harpings
on death and sermonizings on mortality.</p>

<p>Well, being now come near her fated end, and lying
on her deathbed, three days before that event, she did
see her chamber at night all lit up by a brilliant gleam
shining in through the window. She did hereupon chide
her bedchamber women, which were sitting up with her,
asking them for why they did make so big and bright
a fire. But they did answer, that there was but a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
fire burning, and that ’twas the moon which did shine
so bright and cause the illumination. “Why!” she did
exclaim, “there is no moon at this time of the month; it
hath no business to be shining now.” And of a sudden,
bidding open her curtain, she did behold a comet, which
shone right on her bed. “Ah, look!” she cried, “yonder
is a sign which doth not appear for persons of common
quality. God doth show it forth only for us great lords
and ladies. Shut the window again; ’tis a comet, announcing
my death; we must prepare therefor.” So next morning,
having sent to seek her confessor, she did perform
all the duty of a good Christian, albeit the physicians did
assure her she was not yet come to this. “Had I not
seen the sign of my death,” she said, “I should believe you,
for indeed I do not feel me so far gone,” and thereon did
describe to them all the appearance of the comet. Finally,
three days later, leaving all concerns of this world, she did
pass away.</p>

<p>I cannot but believe but that great ladies, and such as
be young, beautiful and high-born, do feel greater and
more sore regret to leave this world than other women.
Yet will I now name some such, which have made light
of death, and have met the same with a good heart, though
for the moment the announcement thereof was exceeding
bitter and hateful to them. The late Comtesse de
<span class="no-wrap">La Rochefoucault,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48*]</a></span>
of the house of Roye, in my opinion and
that of many beside, one of the fairest and most charming
women in all France, when her minister (for she was of the
Reformed Faith, as everybody is aware) did warn her she
must think no more of worldly things, and that her hour
was now come, that she must presently away to God
which was calling her, and leave all worldly vanities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
which were naught as compared with the blessedness of
heaven, she said to him thus: “This is all very well, Sir
Minister, to say to women which have no great contentment
and pleasure in this world, and which have one
foot in the grave already; but to me, that am no more
than in the bloom of mine age and my delight in this world
and my beauty, your sentence is exceeding bitter. And
albeit I have more cause to hug myself in this world than
in any other, and much reason to regret dying, yet would
I fain show you my high courage herein, and do assure
you I take my death with as good will as the most common,
abject, low, foul old crone that ever was in this
world.” So presently, she did set her to sing psalms with
much pious devotion, and so died.</p>

<p>Madame <span class="no-wrap">d’Espernon,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49*]</a></span>
of the house of Candale, was attacked
of so sudden and deadly a malady as that she
was carried off in less than a week. Before her death, she
did essay all remedies which might cure her, imploring
the help of men and of God in most fervent prayers, as
well as of all her friends, and her retainers male and
female, taking it very hard that she was to die so young.
But when they did reason with her and inform her she
must verily and indeed quit this world, and that no remedy
was of any avail: “Is it true?” she said; “leave me alone
then, I will make up my mind to bear it bravely.” These
were the exact words she used. Then lifting up her two
soft, white arms, and laying her two hands one against
the other, with an open look and a confident spirit, she
made her ready to wait death with all patience, and to
leave this world, which she did proceed to abjure in very
pious and Christian terms. Thus did she die as a devout
and good Christian should, at the age of twenty-six, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
one of the handsomest and most charming women of her
time.</p>

<p>’Tis not right, they say, to praise one’s own belongings;
on the other hand what is at once good and true should not
be kept hid. This is why I am fain in this place to commend
Madame <span class="no-wrap">d’Aubeterre,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span>
mine own niece and daughter of my
elder brother, who as all they that have seen her at Court
or elsewhere will go with me in saying, was one of the
fairest and most perfect ladies you could see, as well in
body as in mind. The former did plainly and externally
show forth its excellence in her handsome and charming
face, her graceful figure, and all her sweet mien and bearing;
while for the mind, ’twas divinely gifted and ignorant
of naught it were meet to know. Her discourse was very
fit, simple and unadorned, and did flow right smoothly and
agreeably from her lips, whether in serious converse or in
merry interchange of wit. No woman have I ever seen
which, in my opinion, did more resemble our Queen Marguerite
of France, as well in her general air as in her special
charms; and I did once hear the Queen Mother say
the same. To say this is by itself commendation enough,
so I will add no more; none which have ever seen her,
will, I am well assured, give me the lie as to this. Of a
sudden it befell this lady to be attacked by a malady,
which the physicians did fail to recognize rightly, merely
wasting their Latin in the attempt. Herself, however, did
believe she had been poisoned; though I will not say in
what quarter. Still God will avenge all, and mayhap
the guilty in this matter will yet be punished. She did
all she could in the way of remedies,—though not, she
did declare, because she was afeared of dying. For since
her husband’s death, she had lost all fear of this, albeit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
he was for sure in no wise her equal in merit, nor deserving
of her or of the tender tears her fair eyes did shed after
his death. Yet would she have been right glad to live on a
while longer for the love of her daughter, the which she
was leaving a tender slip of a girl. This last was a good
and excellent reason, while regrets for an husband that was
both foolish and vexatious are surely but vain and idle.</p>

<p>Thus she, seeing now no remedy was of avail, and feeling
her own pulse, which she did herself try and find to be
galloping fast (for she had understanding of all such matters),
two days before she died, did send to summon her
<span class="no-wrap">daughter,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span>
and did make her a very good and pious exhortation,
such as no other mother mayhap that I know of
could have made a finer one or one better expressed,—at
once instructing her how to live in this world and how
to win the grace of God in the next; this ended, she did
give her her blessing, bidding her no more trouble with her
tears the sweet easefulness and repose she was about to
enjoy with God. Presently she did ask for her mirror,
and looking at herself very fixedly therein, did exclaim,
“Ah! traitor face, that doth in no wise declare my sickness
(for indeed ’twas as fair to look on as ever), thou
art yet unchanged; but very soon death, which is drawing
nigh, will have the better of thy beauty, which shall
rot away and be devoured of worms.” Moreover she had
put the most part of her rings on her fingers; and gazing
on these, and her hand withal, which was very well shaped:
“Lo! a vanity I have much loved in days gone-by; yet
now I do quit the same willingly, to bedeck me in the
other world with another much fairer adornment.”</p>

<p>Then seeing her sisters weeping their eyes out at her
bedside, she did comfort them, exhorting them to take in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
good part, as she did, what God was pleased to send her,
and saying that as they had always loved each other so
well, they should not grieve at that which did bring her
only joy and contentment. She did further tell them that
the fond friendship she had ever borne them should be
eternal, beseeching them to return her the like, and above
all to extend it to her child. Presently seeing them but
weep the harder at this, she said once more: “Sisters
mine, an if ye do love me, why do ye not rejoice with
me over the exchange I make of a wretched life for one
most happy? My soul, wearied of so many troubles,
doth long to be free, and to be in blessed rest with Jesus
Christ my Saviour. Yet you would fain have it still
tied to this miserable body, which is but its prison, not
its domicile. I do beseech you, therefore, my sisters,
torment yourselves no more.”</p>

<p>Many other the like words did she prefer, so pious and
Christian as that there is never a Divine, however great
could have uttered better or more blessed,—all which I
do pass over. In especial she did often ask to see Madame
de Bourdeille, her mother, whom she had prayed her sisters
to send fetch, and kept saying to them: “Oh! sisters, is
not Madame de Bourdeille coming yet? Oh! how slow
your couriers be! they be really not fit to ride post and
make special speed.” Her mother did at last arrive, but
never saw her alive, for she had died an hour before.</p>

<p>She did ask earnestly too for me, whom she ever spake
of as her dear uncle, and did send us her last farewell.
She did beg them to have her body opened after death, a
thing she had always strongly abhorred, to the end, as she
said to her sisters, that the cause of her death being more
evidently discovered, this should enable them and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
daughter the better to take precautions and so preserve
their lives. “For I must admit,” she said, “a suspicion
that I was poisoned five years agone along with mine uncle
de Brantôme and my sister the Comtesse de Durtal; but
I did get the biggest piece. Yet would I willingly charge
no one with such a crime, for fear it should prove a false
accusation and my soul be weighted with the guilt thereof,—my
soul which I do earnestly desire may be free of all
blame, rancour, ill-will and sinfulness, that it may fly
straight to God its Creator.”</p>

<p>I should never have done, if I were to repeat all; for
her discourse was full and long, and such as did show no
sign at all of an outwearied body or a weak and failing
spirit. As to this, there was a certain gentleman, her
neighbour, a witty talker and one she had loved to converse
and jest withal, who did present himself and to whom
she said: “Ha, ha! good friend! needs must give in this
fall, tongue and sword and all. So, fare you well!”</p>

<p>Her physician and her sisters did wish her to take some
cordial medicine or other; but she begged them not to give
it her, “for these would merely,” she said, “be helping
to prolong my pain and put off my final rest.” So she did
ask them to leave her alone; and was again and again
heard to say: “Dear God! how gentle sweet is death!
who had ever dreamed it could be so?” Then, little by
little, yielding up her spirit very softly, she did close her
eyes, without making any of those hideous and fearsome
signs that death doth show in many at the supreme
moment.</p>

<p>Madame de Bourdeille, her mother, was not long in
following her. For the melancholy she did conceive at the
death of this her noble daughter did carry her off in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
eighteen months, after a sickness lasting seven months, at
one time giving cause for good hope of recovery, at another
seeming desperate. But from the very first, herself
did declare she would never get the better of it, in no
wise fearing death, and never praying God to grant
her life and health, but only patience in her sufferings
and above that He would send her a peaceful death, and
one neither painful nor long drawn out. And so it befell;
for while we deemed her only fainted, she did give up her
soul so gently as that she was never seen to move either
foot or arm or limb, nor give any fearful and hideous
look; but casting a glance around with eyes that were as
fair as ever, she passed away, remaining as beautiful in
death as she had been when alive and in the plenitude of
her charms.</p>

<p>A sore pity, verily, of her and of all fair ladies that die
so in the bloom of their years! Only I do believe this, that
Heaven, not content with those fair lights which from the
creation of the world do adorn its vault, is fain, beside
these, to have yet other new stars to still illumine us, as
erst they did when alive, with their beauteous eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another example, and then an end:</p>

<p>You have seen in these last days the case of Madame de
<span class="no-wrap">Balagny,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52*]</a></span>
true sister in all ways of the gallant Bussy.
When Cambrai was besieged, she did all ever she could,
of her brave and noble heart, to prevent its being taken;
but after having in vain exhausted herself in every sort
of defensive means she could contrive, and seeing now
’twas all over and the town already in the enemy’s power,
and the citadel soon to go the same road, unable to endure
the smart and heart’s pang of evacuating her Principality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
(for her husband and herself had gotten themselves to be
called Prince and Princess of Cambrai and Cambrésis,—a
title sundry nations did find odious and much too presumptuous,
seeing their rank was but that of plain
gentlefolk), did die of grief and so perished at the post
of honour. Some say she did die by her own hand, an act
deemed however more Pagan than Christian. Be this as it
may, she deserveth but praise for her gallantry and
bravery in all this, and for the rebuke she did administer
her husband at the time of her death, when she thus said
to him: “How can you endure, Balagny, to live on after
your most dismal fall of Fortune, to be a spectacle and
laughing stock to all the world, which will point the finger
of scorn at you, thus falling from great glory whereto
you had been elevated to the low place I see awaiting you,
and if you follow not my example? Learn then of me
to die nobly, and not survive your misfortunes and disgrace.”
’Tis a grand thing thus to see a woman teaching
us how to live,—and how to die. Yet would he neither
obey nor believe her; but at the end of seven or eight
months, quick forgetting the memory of this gallant lady,
he did re-wed with the sister of Madame de
<span class="no-wrap">Monceaux,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span>
no doubt a fair and honourable damosel,—manifesting to all
and sundry how that to keep alive was his one thing
needful, be it on what terms it may.</p>

<p>Of a surety life is good and sweet; natheless is a noble
death greatly to be commended, such as was this lady’s,
who dying as she did of grief, doth appear of a contrary
complexion to that of some women, which are said to be of
an opposite nature to men, for that they do die of joy and
in joy.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Of</span> this sort of death I will allege only the
instance of Mlle. de Limueil, the elder, which
did die at Court, being one of the Queen’s
maids of honour. All through her sickness,
whereof she died, her tongue did never leave off wagging,
but she did talk continuously; for she was a very great
chatterbox, a sayer of very witty and telling scoffs, and
a very fine woman withal. When the hour of her death
was come, she did summon her chamber valet to her; for
each maid of honour hath her own. He was called Julian,
and did play excellently on the violin. “Julian,” saith
she to him, “come take your violin and go on playing
me the <i>Défaite des Suisses</i> (Switzers’
<span class="no-wrap">Rout)<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span>
till I be dead,
and play it as well as ever you can; and when you come to
the words, <i>Tout est perdu</i> (“All is lost”), play the passage
over four or five times as pathetically as you may.” This
the other did, while she joined in with her voice; and when
’twas come to <i>Tout est perdue</i>, she did repeat it over twice.
Then turning to the other side of the bed, she cried to her
friends: “Yes! all is lost this bout, and for good and all,”
and so died. Truly a death we may call gay and pleasant!
This tale I have of two of her companions, persons of
credit, who saw the mystery played out.</p>

<p>If then there be women which do die of joy and in
joyous wise, no less are men to be found which have done
the like. Thus we read of that great Pope, Leo X., how
he did die of joy and delight, when he beheld us Frenchmen
driven out altogether from the State of Milan; so sore
a hate he bare us!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>

<p>The late Grand Prior, M. de Lorraine, did one time
conceive the wish to send a pair of his Galleys on an expedition
to the Levant under the command of Captain
Beaulieu, one of his Lieutenants, of the which I have spoke
somewhat in another place. Beaulieu went readily enough,
being a brave and valiant sailor. When he was toward the
Archipelago, he did fall in with a great Venetian ship, well
armed and well found, which he set him to fire upon. But
the ship did return his salute to some purpose; for at the
first volley she did carry clean away two of his banks of
oars, galley-slaves and all. Amongst other sore wounded
was his Lieutenant, a man named Captain Panier (“Basket”)
and a good fellow enough, which had time to cry out
this word only before he died: “Good-bye baskets all,
the harvest is done,”—a merry and a pleasant jest to
enliven his death withal! The end was, M. de Beaulieu had
to retire, this big ship proving beyond his power to overcome.</p>

<p>The first year King Charles IX. was King, at the time of
the July edict when he was yet residing in the Faubourg
St. Germain, we did see the hanging of a certain gallows-bird
in that quarter, which had stolen six silver goblets
from the kitchen of the Prince de La Roche-sur-Yonne.
So soon as he was on the ladder, he did beg the hangman
to grant him a little space for a dying speech, and did take
up his parable, remonstrating with the folk and telling
them he was unjustly put to death, “for never,” said he,
“have I practised my thievings on the poor, on beggars
and the vulgar herd, but only on Princes and great Lords,
which be greater thieves than we, and do rob us every
day of their lives; and ’tis a good deed to recover again
of these folk what they do rob and filch from us.” Much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
more diverting nonsense of the sort he did utter, the which
’twere but wasted time to repeat. Presently the priest
which was with him at the top of the ladder, turning to
the people, as we see done, did call upon them: “Good
sirs! this poor criminal doth recommend himself to your
prayers; we will say all together for him and his soul’s
peace a <i>Pater noster</i> and an <i>Ave Maria</i>, and will sing
a <i>Salve</i>.” Then just as the folk were answering, the said
poor criminal did drop his head, and fixing his eyes on
the priest, did start bellowing like a calf, and making
mock of the priest in the most absurd fashion; then lending
him a kick, did send him flying from the top of the
ladder to the bottom, so big a leap that he brake a leg.
“Ah, ha! Sir priest!” cried the fellow, “God’s truth, I
knew I should shift you. Well! you’ve got your gruel
now, my fine fellow.” Hearing him groan, he did set up
a loud and hearty guffaw; then this ended, did jump off
the ladder of his own motion and set himself a-swinging
into space. I dare swear the Court did laugh merrily at
the trick, albeit the poor priest had done himself a serious
hurt. A death, in good sooth, that can scarce be called
grave and melancholy!</p>

<p>The late deceased M. d’Estampes had a fool called
Colin, a very diverting fellow. When his death was now
nigh, his master did enquire how Colin was doing. They
told him, “But poorly, my Lord; he is going to die, for
he will take nothing.”—“Come now,” said M. d’Estampes,
who was at the moment at table, “take him this soup,
and tell him, an if he will not take somewhat for love of
me, I will never love him more, for they inform me he
will take naught.” The message was delivered to Colin,
who, death already ’twixt the teeth of him, did make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
answer, “And who be they which have told my Lord I
would take naught?” Then being surrounded by a countless
cloud of flies (for ’twas summer time), he began to
hunt them with his hand, as we see pages and lackeys and
children do, a-trying to catch them; and having taken two
with one swoop, he cried, making a funny gesture more
readily imagined than described, “Go tell my Lord,” said
he, “what I have taken for love of him, and that now I’m
away to the kingdom of the flies,” and so saying and
turning him round to the other side of the bed, the merry
rascal did expire.</p>

<p>As to this, I have heard sundry philosophers declare
that folk do very often at the moment of death remember
them of those things they have the most loved in life,
and tell of these; so gentlemen, soldiers, sportsmen, artisans,
all in fact, very near, according to their former
occupation, do say some word thereof when a-dying. This
is a fact often noted no less in past time than at the
present day.</p>

<p>Women in like wise do often out with a similar rigmarole,—whores
just as much as honest dames. So have I
heard speak of a certain lady, of very good quality too,
which on her death-bed did exult to spit out all about her
divers intrigues, naughtinesses and past pleasures, to such
purpose that she told more thereof than ever folk had
known before, albeit she had always been suspected as a
desperate wanton. This revelation she may have made,
either in a dream possibly, or else because truth, that can
never be hid, did constrain her thereto, or mayhap because
she was fain so to discharge her conscience. Anyhow,
she did actually, with clear conscience and true repentance,
confess and ask forgiveness for her sins, detailing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
them each and all, dotting i’s and crossing t’s, till all
was as clear as day. Verily, a curious thing, she should
have found leisure at that supreme hour so to be sweeping
her conscience clean of such a muckheap of scandal,—and
with such careful particularity.</p>

<p>Another good lady I have heard of which was so apt
to dream every night, as that she would tell out by night
everything she did by day, in such wise that she did bring
sore suspicion of herself on her husband’s part, who did
presently set himself to listen to her talking and prattling
and pay heed to her dreams, whereby an ill fate did later
on befall her.</p>

<p>’Tis no long while since a gentleman of the great world,
belonging to a province I will not name, did the same
thing on his death-bed, publishing abroad his loves and
lecheries, and specifying the ladies, wives and maids,
which he had had to do with, and in what places, and how
and under what circumstances. All this he did confess
loud out, asking God’s pardon therefor before everybody.
This last did worse than the woman just mentioned, for
whereas she did bring disrepute on herself only, he did
blacken several fair ladies’ good name. A fine pair of
gallants truly!</p>

<p>’Tis said that misers, both male and female, have likewise
this trick of thinking much, in the hour of death,
on their hoard of crowns, forever talking of the same.
Some forty years agone there was a certain lady of
<span class="no-wrap">Mortemar,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55*]</a></span>
one of the richest ladies in all Poitou and one of the
most moneyed, which afterward when she came to die had
never a thought for aught but her crowns that were in her
closet. All the time of her sickness, she would rise from
her bed twenty times a day to go visit her treasure. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the last, when she was now very nigh her end and the priest
was exhorting her to think of the life eternal, she would
make no other reply nor say any other word but only this:
“Give me my gown; the villains are robbing me.” Her
one thought was to rise and visit her strong-room, as she
did sore strive to do, but the effort was beyond the poor
lady. And so she died.</p>

<p>I have let myself toward the end wander a little away
from the first intention of my present Discourse; but we
should bear in mind that after preaching and tragedy,
farce ever cometh next. With this word, I make an end.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> point there is to be noted in these fair and
honourable dames which do indulge in love, to
wit that whatsoever freedom they do allow
themselves, they will never willingly suffer
offence or scandal to be said of them by others, and if
any do say ill of them, they know very well how to avenge
the affront sooner or later. In a word, they be ready
enough to do the thing, but unwilling it should be spoken
about. And in very sooth ’tis not well done to bring ill
repute on an honourable lady, nor to divulge on her;
for indeed what have a number of other folks to do with
it, an if they <i>do</i> please their senses and their lovers’ to
boot?</p>

<p>The Courts of our French Kings, and amongst others,
those of later years in especial, have been greatly given
to blazon abroad the faults of these worthy dames; and
I have known the days when was never a gallant about
the Palace but did discover some falsehood to tell against
the ladies, or at least find some true though scandalous
tale to repeat. All this is very blameworthy; for a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
ought never to offend the honour of fair ladies, and least
of all great ladies. And I do say this as well to such
as do reap enjoyment of ladies’ favour, as to them which
cannot taste the venison, and for this cause do decry the
same.</p>

<p>The Courts of our later Kings have, I repeat it, been
overmuch given to this scandal-mongering and tale-bearing,—herein
differing widely from those of earlier Sovereigns,
their predecessors, alway excepting that of Louis
XI., that seasoned reprobate. Of him ’tis said that most
times he would eat at a common table, in open Hall, with
many gentlemen of his privy household and others withal;
and whoever could tell him the best and most lecherous
story of light women and their doings, this man was best
welcomed and made most of. Himself, too, showed no
scruple to do the like, for he was exceeding inquisitive
and loved to be informed of all secrets; then having found
these out, he would often divulge the same to companions,
and that publicly.[57] This was indeed a very grave scandal.
He had a most ill opinion of women, and an entire disbelief
in their chastity. After inviting the King of England to
Paris on a visit of good fellowship, and being taken at
his word by that Prince, he did straight repent him, and
invented an <i>alibi</i> to break off the engagement. “Holy
Christ!” he said on this occasion, “I don’t want him coming
here. He would certainly find some little smart, dainty
minx, that he would fall over head and ears in love with,
who would tempt him to stay longer and come oftener
than I should at all like.”</p>

<p>Natheless of his <span class="no-wrap">wife<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span>
he had a very high opinion, who
was a very modest and virtuous lady; and truly she had
need be so, for else, being a distrustful and suspicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Prince if ever there was one, he would very soon have
treated her like the rest. And when he died, he did charge
his son to love and honour his mother well, but not to be
ruled of her,—“not that she was not both wise and
chaste,” he declared, “but that she was more Burgundian
than <span class="no-wrap">French.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58*]</a></span>
And indeed he did never really love her but
to have an heir of her; and when he had gotten this, he
made scarce any account of her more. He kept her at
the Castle of Amboise like a plain Gentlewoman in very
scanty state and as ill-dressed as any young country girl.
There he would leave her with few attendants to say her
prayers, while himself was away travelling and taking his
pleasure elsewhere. I leave you to imagine, such being
the opinion the King held of women, and such his delight
in speaking ill of them, how they were maltreated by every
evil tongue at Court. Not that he did otherwise wish them
ill for so taking their pleasure, nor that he desired to stop
their amusements at all, as I have seen some fain to do;
but his chiefest joy was to gird at them, the effect being
that these poor ladies, weighed down under such a load
of detraction, were often hindered from kicking of their
heels so freely as they would else have liked to do. Yet
did harlotry much prevail in his day; for the King himself
did greatly help to establish and keep up the same with
the gentlemen of his Court. Then was the only question,
who could make the merriest mock thereat, whether in
public or in privity, and who could tell the merriest tales
of the ladies’ wantonings and <i>wriggles</i> (this was his
phrase) and general naughtiness. True it is the names
of great ladies were left unmentioned, such being censured
only by guess-work and appearances; and I ween they
had a better time than some I have seen in the days of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the late King, which did torment and chide and bully them
most strangely. Such is the account I have heard of that
good monarch, Louis XI., from divers old stagers.</p>

<p>At any rate his son, King Charles VIII., which did
succeed him, was not of this complexion; for ’tis reported
of him now that he was the most reticent and fair-speaking
monarch was even seen, and did never offend man or
woman by the very smallest ill <span class="no-wrap">word.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span>
I leave you then to
think of the fair ladies of his reign, and all merry lovers
of the sex, did not have good times in those days. And
indeed he did love them right well and faithfully,—in fact
too well; for returning back from his Naples expedition
triumphant and victorious, he did find such excessive
diversion in loving and fondling the same, and pleasuring
them with so many delights at Lyons, in the way of tournaments
and tourneys which he did hold for love of them,
that clean forgetting his partisans which he had left in
that Kingdom, he did leave these to perish,—and towns
and kingdom and castles to boot, which yet held out, and
were stretching forth hands of supplication to him to send
them succour. ’Tis said moreover that overmuch devotion
to the ladies was the cause of his death, for by reason
of a too reckless abandonment to these pleasures, he did,
being of a very weakly frame of body, so enervate and
undermine his health as that this behaviour did no little
contribute to his death.</p>

<p>Our good King Louis XII. was very respectful toward
the ladies; for as I have said in another place, he would
ever pardon all stage-players, as well as scholars and
clerks of the Palace in their guilds, no matter who they
did make free to speak of, excepting the Queen his wife,
and her ladies and damosels,—albeit he was a merry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
gallant in his day and did love fair women as well as
other folk. Herein he did take after his grand-father,
Duke Louis of Orleans,—though not in this latter’s ill
tongue and inordinate conceit and boastfulness. And
truly this defect did cost him his life, for one day having
boasted loud out at a banquet whereat Duke John of
Burgundy, his cousin, was present, how that he had in
his private closet portraits of all the fairest ladies he
had enjoyed, as chance would have it, Duke John himself
did enter this same closet. The very first lady whose
picture he beheld there, and the first sight that met his
eyes, was his own most noble lady wife, which was at that
day held in high esteem for her beauty. She was called
Marguerite, daughter of Albert of Bavaria, Count of
Hainault and Zealand. Who was amazed then? who but
the worthy husband? Fancy him muttering low down
to himself, “Ha, ha! I see it all!” However, making no
outcry about the flea that really bit him, he did hide it all,
though hatching vengeance, be sure, for a later day, and
so picked a quarrel with him as to his regency and administration
of the Kingdom. Thus putting off his grievance
on this cause and not on any matter of his wife at
all, he had the Duke assassinated at the Porte Barbette of
Paris. Then presently his first wife being now dead (we
may suspect by poison), and right soon after, he
did wed in the second place the daughter of Louis, third
Duke of Bourbon. Mayhap this bargain was no better
than his first; for truly with folks which be meet for
horns, change bed-chamber and quarters as they may, they
will ever encounter the same.</p>

<p>The Duke in this matter did very wisely, so to avenge
him of his adultery without setting tongues a-wagging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
of his concerns or his wife’s, and ’twas a judicious piece
of dissimulation on his part. Indeed I have heard a very
great nobleman and soldier say, how that there be three
things a wise man ought never to make public, an if he
be wronged therein. Rather should he hold his tongue
on the matter, or better still invent some other pretext
to fight upon and get his revenge,—unless that is the
thing was so clear and manifest, and so public to many
persons, as that he could not possibly put off his action
onto any other motive but the true one.</p>

<p>The first is, when ’tis brought up against a man that
he is cuckold and his wife unfaithful; another, when he is
taxed with buggery and sodomy; the third, when ’tis
stated of him that he is a coward, and that he hath basely
run away from a fight or a battle. All three charges be
most shameful, when a man’s name is mentioned in connection
therewith; so he doth fight the accusation, and
will sometimes suppose he can well clear himself and prove
his name to have been falsely smirched. But the matter
being thus made public, doth cause only the greater scandal;
and the more ’tis stirred, the more doth it stink,
exactly as vile stench waxeth worse, the more it is disturbed.
And this is why ’tis always best, if a man can
with honour, to hold his tongue, and contrive and invent
some new motive to account for his punishment of the
old offence; for such like grievances should ever be ignored
so far as may be, and never brought into court, or made
subjects of discussion or contention. Many examples
could I bring of this truth; but ’twould be over irksome
to me, and would unduly lengthen out my Discourse.</p>

<p>So we see Duke John was very wise and prudent thus to
dissimulate and hide his horns, and on quite other grounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
take his revenge on his cousin, which had shamed him.
Else had he been made mock of, and his name blazoned
abroad. No doubt dread of such mockery and scandal
did touch him as nigh at heart as ever his ambition, and
made him act like the wise and experienced man of the
world he was.</p>

<p>Now, however, to return from the digression which hath
delayed me, our King Francis I., who was a good lover
of fair ladies, and that in spite of the opinion he did express,
as I have said elsewhere, how that they were fickle
and inconstant creatures, would never have the same ill
spoke of at his Court, and was always most anxious they
should be held in all high respect and
<span class="no-wrap">honour.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60*]</a></span>
I have heard it related how that one time, when he was spending
his Lent at Meudon near Paris, there was one of the
gentlemen in his service there named the Sieur de Brizambourg,
of Saintogne. As this gentleman was serving the
King with meat, he having a dispensation to eat thereof,
his master bade him carry the rest, as we see sometimes
done at Court, to the ladies of the privy company, whose
names I had rather not give, for fear of offence. The
gentleman in question did take upon him to say, among
his comrades and others of the Court, how that these ladies
not content with eating of raw meat in Lent, were now
eating cooked as well,—and their belly full. The ladies
hearing of it, did promptly make complaint to the King,
which thereupon was filled with so great an anger, as that
he did instantly command the archers of the Palace guard
to take the man and hang him out of hand. By lucky
chance the poor gentleman had wind of what was a-foot
from one of his friends, and so fled and escaped in the
nick of time. But an if he had been caught, he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
most certainly have been hanged, albeit he was a man of
good quality, so sore was the King seen to be wroth that
time, and little like to go back on his word. I have this
anecdote of a person of honour and credibility which was
present; and at the time the King did say right out, that
any man which should offend the honour of ladies, the same
should be hanged without benefit of clergy.</p>

<p>A little while before, Pope <span class="no-wrap">Farnese<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61*]</a></span>
being come to Nice,
and the King paying him his respects in state with all his
Court and Lords and Ladies, there were some of these last,
and not the least fair of the company, which did go to the
Pope for to kiss his slipper. Whereupon a gentleman did
take on him to say they had gone to beg his Holiness for a
dispensation to taste of raw flesh without sin or shame,
whenever and as much as ever they might desire. The
King got to know thereof; and well it was for the gentleman
he did fly smartly, else had he been hanged, as well
for the veneration due to the Pope as for the respect
proper to fair ladies.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">These</span> gentlemen were not so happy in their
speeches and interviews as was once the late
deceased M. d’Albanie. The time when Pope
Clement did visit Marseilles to celebrate the
marriage of his niece with M. d’Orleans, there were three
widow ladies, of fair face and honourable birth, which by
reason of the pains, vexations and griefs they suffered
from the absence of their late husbands and of those
pleasures that were no more, had come so low, and grown
so thin, weak and sickly, as that they did beseech M. d’Albanie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
their kinsman, who did possess a good share of the
Pope’s favour, to ask of him dispensation for the three of
them to eat meat on prohibited days. This the said Duke
did promise them to do, and to that end did one day bring
them on a friendly footing to the Pope’s lodging. Meantime
he had warned the King of what was a-foot, telling
him he would afford him some sport. So having put him
up to the game, and the three ladies being on their knees
before his Holiness, M. d’Albanie took the word first,
saying in a low tone and in Italian, so that the ladies did
not catch his words: “Holy Father, see here before you
three widow ladies, fair to look on and very well born.
These same for the respect they bear toward their dead
husbands and the love they have for the children they have
borne to these, will not for aught in all the world marry
again and so wrong their husbands and children. But
whereas they be sometimes sore tempted by the pricks of
the flesh, they do therefore humbly beseech your Holiness
for leave to go with men without marriage, whenever and
wherever they shall find them under the said temptation.”—“What
say you, cousin?” cried the Pope. “Why!
’twould be against God’s own commandments, wherefrom
I can give no dispensation.” “Well! the ladies are here
before you, Holy Father, and if it please you to hear them
say their say.” At this one of the three, taking the word,
said: “Holy Father! we have besought M. d’Albanie to
make you our very humble petition for us three poor
women, and to represent to your Holiness our frailty and
our weakly complexion.”—“Nay! my daughters,” replied
the Pope, “but your petition is in no wise reasonable, for
the thing would be clean against God’s commandments.”
Then the widows, still quite ignorant of what M. d’Albanie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
had told the Pope, made answer: “At the least, Holy
Father, may it please you give us leave three times a week,
without scandal to our name.”—“What!” exclaimed the
Pope, “give you leave to commit <i>il peccato di lussuria</i>
(the sin of lasciviousness?). I should damn mine own
soul; I cannot do it!” Hereupon the three ladies, perceiving
at last ’twas a case of scampishness and knavery,
and that M. d’Albanie had played a trick on them, declared,
“’Tis not of that we speak, Holy Father; we but
ask permission to eat meat on prohibited days.”—Hearing
these words, the Duc d’Albanie told them, “Nay! I
thought ’twas live flesh you meant, ladies!” The Pope
was quick to understand the knavery put on them, and
said with a dawning smile, “You have put these noble ladies
to the blush, my cousin; the Queen will be angered when
she doth hear of it.” The Queen did hear of it anon, but
made no ado, and found the tale diverting. The King
likewise did afterward make good mirth thereof with the
Pope; while the Holy Father himself, after giving them
his benediction, did grant them the dispensation they
craved, and dismissed them well content.</p>

<p>I have been given the names of the three ladies concerned,
namely: Madame de Chasteau-Briant or Madame
de Canaples, Madame de Chastillon and the Baillive de
Caen, all three very honourable ladies. I have the tale
from sundry old frequenters of the Court.</p>

<p>Madame <span class="no-wrap">d’Uzès<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span>
did yet better, at the time when Pope
Paul III. came to Nice to visit King Francis. She was
then Madame du Bellay, and a lady which hath from her
youth up always had merry ways and spake many a witty
word. One day, prostrating herself at his Holiness’ feet,
she did make three supplications to him: first, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
grant her absolution, for that when yet a little maid,
in waiting on the Queen Regent’s majesty, and called by
the name of Tallard, she did lose her scissors while sewing
of her seam, and did make a vow to St. Allivergot to
perform the same, an if she found them. This she presently
did, yet did never accomplish her vow, not knowing
where the said Saint’s body lay. The second petition was
that he give her pardon forasmuch as, when Pope Clement
came to Marseilles, she being still Mlle. Tallard, she did
take one of the pillows of his Holiness’ bed, and did wipe
herself therewith in front and in rear, on the which his
Holiness did afterward rest his noble head and face. The
third was this, that the Sieur de Tays, because she did love
the same, but he loved not her, and the man is accursed
and should be excommunicated which loveth not again, if
he be loved.</p>

<p>The Pope at first was sore astonished at these requests,
but having enquired of the King who she was, did learn her
witty ways, and laughed heartily over the matter with the
King. Yet from that day forth all she did was found
admirable, so good a grace did she display in all her ways
and words.</p>

<p>Now never suppose this same great monarch was so
strict and stern in his respect for ladies, as that he did
not relish well enough any good stories told him concerning
them, without however any scandal-mongering or
decrying of their good name. Rather like the great and
highly privileged King he was, he would not that every
man, and all the vulgar herd, should enjoy like privileges
with himself.</p>

<p>I have heard sundry relate how he was ever most anxious
that the noble gentlemen of his Court should never be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
without mistresses. If they won none such, he did deem
them simpletons and empty fools; while many a time he
would ask one Courtier or another the name of the lady
of his choice, and promise to do them good service in that
quarter, and speak well of their merits. So good-natured
a Prince was he and an affable. Oftentimes too, when he
did observe his gentlemen full of free discourse with their
mistresses, he would come up and accost them, asking
what merry and gallant words they were exchanging
with their ladies, and if he found the same not to his
liking, correcting them and teaching them better. With
his most intimate friends, he was no wise shy or sparing
to tell his stories and share his good things with them.
One diverting tale I have heard him tell, which did happen
to himself, and which he did later on repeat. This was of
a certain young and pretty lady new come to Court, the
which being little skilled in the ways of the world, did very
readily yield to the persuasions of the great folks, and in
especial those of the said monarch himself. One day when
he was fain to erect his noble standard and plant the same
in her fort, she having heard it said, and indeed begun
to note that when one gave a thing to the King, or took
aught from him and touched it, the person must first
kiss the hand for to take and touch it withal, did herself
without more ado fulfil the obligation and first very
humbly kissing her hand did seize the King’s standard
and plant it in the fort with all due humbleness. Then did
she ask him in cold blood, how he did prefer her to love
him, as a respectable and modest lady, or as a wanton.
No doubt he did ask her for the latter, for herein was she
more able to show herself more agreeable than as a modest
woman. And indeed he soon found out she had by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
means wasted her time, both after the event and before it,
and all. When all was done, she would drop him a deep
curtsy, thanking him respectfully for the honour he had
done her, whereof she was all unworthy, often suggesting
to him at the same time some promotion for her husband.
I have heard the lady’s name, one which hath since grown
much less simple than at first she was, and is nowadays
cunning and experienced enough. The King made no ado
about repeating the tale, which did reach the ears of not
a few folks.</p>

<p>This monarch was exceeding curious to hear of the love
of both men and women, and above all their amorous engagements,
and in especial what fine airs the ladies did
exhibit when at their gentle work, and what looks and
attitudes they did display therein, and what words they
said. On hearing all this, he would laugh frank and free,
but after would forbid all publishing abroad thereof and
any scandal making, always strongly recommending an
honourable secrecy on these matters.</p>

<p>He had for his good follower herein that great, most
magnificent and most generous nobleman, the Cardinal de
Lorraine. Most generous I may well call him, for he had
not his like in his day; his free expenditure, his many
gracious gifts and kindnesses, did all bear witness thereof,
and above all else his charity toward the poor. He would
regularly bear with him a great game-bag, the which his
valet of the bed-chamber, who did govern his petty cash,
never failed to replenish, every morning, with three or four
hundred crowns. And as many poor folk as he met, he
would plunge his hand in the game-bag, and whatsoever
he drew out therefrom, without a moment’s thought, he
gave away, and without any picking or choosing. ’Twas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
of him a poor blind man, as the Cardinal was passing in
the streets of Rome and was asked for an alms, and so did
throw him according to wont a great handful of gold,
said thus, crying out aloud in the Italian tongue: <i>O tu
sei Christo, o veramente el cardinal di Lorrena</i>,—“Either
you are Christ, or the Cardinal de Lorraine.” Moreover
if he was generous and charitable in this way, he was no
less liberal toward other folks as well, and chiefly where
fair ladies were concerned, whom he did easily attach to
him by this regale. For money was not so greatly abundant
in those days as it hath nowadays become, and for
this cause women were more eager after the same, and
every sort of merry living and gay attire.</p>

<p>I have heard it said that ever on the arrival at Court of
any fair damsel or young wife that was handsome and
attractive, he would come instantly to greet the same, and
discoursing with her would presently offer to undertake
the training of her. A pretty trainer for sooth! I ween
the task was not so irksome an one as to train and break
some wild colt. Accordingly ’twas said at that time, was
scarce dame or damsel resident at Court or newly come
thither, but was caught and debauched by dint of her own
avariciousness and the largesse of the aforesaid Cardinal;
and few or none have come forth of that Court women
of chastity and virtue. Thus might their chests and big
wardrobes be seen for that time more full of gowns and
petticoats, of cloth of gold and silver and of silk, than
be nowadays those of our Queens and great Princesses of
the present time. I know this well, having seen the thing
with mine own eyes in two or three instances,—fair ladies
which had gotten all this gear by their dainty body; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
neither father, mother nor husband could have given them
the same in anything like such wealth and abundance.</p>

<p>Nay! but I should have refrained me, some will say,
from stating so much of the great Cardinal, in view of his
honoured cloth and most reverend and high estate. Well!
his King would have it so, and did find pleasure therein;
and pleasure one’s Sovereign, a man is dispensed of all
scruple, whether in making love or other matters, provided
always they be not dishonourable. Accordingly he did
make no ado about going to the wars, and hunting and
dancing, taking part in mascarades, and the like sports
and pastimes. Moreover he was a man of like flesh and
blood with other folk, and did possess many great merits
and perfections of his own, enough surely to outweigh and
cloak this small fault,—if fault it is to be called, to love
fair ladies!</p>

<p>I have heard the following tale told of him in connection
with the proper respect due to ladies. He was naturally
most courteous toward them; yet did he once forget his
usual practice, and not without reason enough, with the
Duchess of Savoy, Donna Beatrix of Portugal. Travelling
on one occasion through Piedmont, on his way to
Rome on his Royal master’s service, he did visit the
Duke and Duchess. After having conversed a sufficient
while with the Duke, he went to find the noble Duchess
in her chamber for to pay his respects to her; arrived
there and on his coming forward toward her, her Grace,
who was haughtiness itself, if ever was such in the world,
did offer him her hand to kiss. The Cardinal, loath to put
up with this affront, did press forward to kiss her on the
mouth, while she did draw back all she could. Then losing
all patience and crowding up yet nearer to her, he takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
her fairly by the head, and in spite of her struggles did
kiss her two or three times over. And albeit she did protest
sore with many cries and exclamations both in Portuguese
and Spanish, yet had she to endure this treatment.
“What!” the Cardinal cried out; “is it to me this sort
of state and ceremony is to be used? I do kiss right
enough the Queen of France my Mistress, which is the
greatest Queen in all the world, and I am not to kiss you,
a dirty little slip of a duchess! I would have you to
know I have bedded with ladies as fair as you, and as
good to boot, and of better birth than ever you be.” And
mayhap he spoke but the truth. Anyway the Princess
was ill-advised to make this show of haughtiness toward
a Prince of so high an house, and above all towards a
Cardinal; for there is never one of this exalted rank in
the Church, but doth liken himself with the greatest Princes
of Christendom. The Cardinal too was in the wrong
to take so harsh reprisals; but ’tis ever very irksome to a
noble and generous spirit, of whatever estate and calling,
to put up with an affront.</p>

<p>Another of the same rank, the Cardinal de Granvelle,
did likewise well know how to make the Comte d’Egmont
feel his displeasure on the same account, and others too
whose names be at the tip of my pen, but whom I will pass
over for fear of confusing my subject overmuch, though
I may return again to them later. I do now confine myself
to our late King Henri le Grand, which monarch was
exceeding respectful to the ladies, whom he was used to
treat with all reverence, and did alway hate gainsayers
of their honour. And when so great King doth so serve
fair ladies, a monarch of such puissance and repute, very
loath for sure be all men of his Court to open mouth for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
to speak ill of the same. Beside, the Queen mother did
exert a strong hand to guard her ladies and damsels, and
make calumniators and satirists feel the weight of her
resentment, when once they were found out, seeing how
she had been as little spared by such as any of her ladies.
Yet ’twas never herself she did take heed for so much as
others, seeing, she was used to declare, how she did know
her soul and conscience pure and void of offence, and could
afford to laugh at these foul-mouthed writers and scandal-mongers.
“Why! let them say their worst,” she would say,
“and have their trouble for nothing”; yet whenever she
did catch them at it, she knew how to make them smart
soundly.</p>

<p>It befell the elder Mlle. de Limeuil, at her first coming
to Court, to compose a satire or lampoon (for she had
the gift of witty speech and writing) on the Court generally,
not however so much scandalous in its matter as
diverting in form. Be assured the King’s mother did
make her pay for this well and feel the whip smartly, as
well as two of her comrades which were in the secret to
her majesty, through the house of Turenne, which is allied
to that of Boulogne, she would have been chastised
with every ignominy, and this by express order of the
King, who had the most particular and curious dislike of
such writings.</p>

<p>I do remember me of an incident connected with the
Sieur de <span class="no-wrap">Matha,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63*]</a></span>
a brave and gallant gentleman much
loved of the King, and a kinsman of Madame de Valentinois,
which did ever have some diverting quarrel and
complaint against the damsels and dames of the Court,
of so merry a complexion was he. One day having attacked
one of the Queen’s maids of honour, another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
known by the name of “big Méray,” was for taking up the
cudgels for her companion. The only reply Matha did
vouchsafe her was this: “Go to! I’m not attacking you,
Méray; you’re a great war-horse, and should be
<span class="no-wrap">barded!”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span>
For insooth she was the very biggest woman, maid or
wife, I have ever seen. She did make complaint of the
speech to the Queen, saying the other had called her a
mare and a great war-horse to be barded. The Queen
was so sore angered that Matha had to quit the Court
for some days, spite of all the favour he had with his kinswoman
Madame de Valentinois; and for a month after
his return durst not set foot in the apartment of the
Queen and her maids of honour.</p>

<p>The Sieur de Gersay did a much worse thing toward
one of the Queen’s maids of honour, to whom he was ill-disposed,
for to avenge him upon her, albeit he was never
at a loss for ready words; for indeed he was as good as
most at saying a witty thing or telling a good story, and
above all when spreading a scandal, of which art and
mystery he was a past master; only scandal-mongering
was at that time strongly forbidden. One day when he
was present at the after dinner assembly of the Queen
along with the other ladies and gentlemen of her Court,
the custom then being that the company should not sit
except on the floor when the Queen was present, de Gersay
having taken from the pages and lackeys a ram’s pizzle
they were playing with in the Office Court of the Palace,
sitting down beside her he did slip the same into the girl’s
frock, and this so softly as that she did never notice it,—that
is not until the Queen did proceed to rise from her
chair to retire to her private apartment. The girl, whose
name I had better not give, did straight spring up, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
she rose to her feet, right in front of the Queen, doth give
so lusty a push to the strange plaything she had about
her, as that it did make six or seven good bounces along
the floor, for all the world as though it were fain of its
own accord to give the company a free exhibition and
some gratuitous sport. Who more astonished than the
poor girl,—and the Queen to boot, for ’twas well in front
of her with naught to prevent her view? “Mother of
God!” cried the Queen, “and what is that, my child;
what would you be at with that thing?” The unhappy
maid of honour, blushing and half fainting with confusion,
began to cry out she knew not what it was, that
some one who did wish her ill had played this horrid
trick on her, and how she thought ’twas none other
but de Gersay which had done it. The latter waiting
only to see the beginning of the sport and the first few
bounces, was through the door by now. They sent to
call him back, but he would never come, perceiving the
Queen to be so very wroth, yet stoutly denying the whole
thing all the while. So he was constrained for some days
to fly her resentment, and the King’s too; and indeed had
he not been, along with <span class="no-wrap">Fontaine-Guérin,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65*]</a></span>
one of the Dauphin’s
prime favourites, he would assuredly have been in
sore straits, albeit naught could ever be proven against
him except by guess-work, and notwithstanding the fact
that the King and his courtiers and not a few ladies could
not refrain them from laughing at the incident, though
they durst not show their amusement in view of the
Queen’s displeasure. For was never a lady in all the
world knew better than she how to startle folk with a
sudden and sore rebuke.</p>

<p>A certain honourable gentleman of the Court and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
maid of honour did one time, from the good affection they
erst had with one another, fall into hate and sore quarrel;
this went so far that one day the young lady said loud
out to him in the Queen’s apartment, the twain being in
talk as to their difference: “Leave me alone, Sir, else I
will tell what you told me.” The gentleman, who had informed
her in strict confidence of something about a very
great lady, and fearing ill would befall him from it, and
at the least he would be banished the Court, without more
ado did answer back,—for he was ready enough of speech:
“If you do tell what I have told you, I will tell what I
have done to you.” Who more astonished than the lady
at this? yet did she contrive to reply: “Why! what have
you done to me?” The other did reply: “Why! what
have I told you?” Thereupon doth the lady make answer:
“Oh! I know very well what you told me.” To
which the other: “Oh! and I know very well what I did
to you.” The lady doth retort, “But I’ll prove quite
clearly what you told me;” and the other: “And I’ll
prove clearer still what I did to you.” At long last, after
sticking a long while at this counterchange of reply and
retort in identical form and almost the same words, they
were parted by the gentlemen and ladies there present,
albeit these got much diversion from the dispute.</p>

<p>This disputation having come to the Queen’s ears, the
latter was in great wrath thereanent, and was fain at
once to know the words of the one and the deeds of the
other, and did send to summon them. But the pair of
them, seeing ’twas to be made a serious matter, did consult
and straight agree together to say, whenas they did
appear before the Queen, how that ’twas merely a game
their so disputing with each other, and that neither had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
she been told aught by the gentleman, nor yet had he
done aught to her. So did they balk the Queen, which
did none the less chide and sore blame the courtier, on
the ground that his words were over free and like to make
scandal. The man sware to me twenty times over that,
and if they had not so made it up and agreed in a tale,
and the lady had actually revealed the secret he had told
her, which might well have turned to his great injury, he
would have resolutely maintained he had done his will on
her, challenging them to examine her, and if she should
not be found virgin, that ’twas himself had deflowered
her. “Well and good!” I answered, “but an if they had
examined her and found her a maid, for she was quite
young and unmarried, you would have been undone, and
’twould have gone hard but you had lost your life.”—“Body
of me!” he did return, “that’s just what I should
have liked the best, that they should have examined the
jade. I was well assured of my tale, for I knew quite well
who had deflowered her, and that another man had been
there right enough, though not I,—to my much regret.
So being found already touched and soiled, she had been
undone, and I avenged, and her good name ruined to boot.
I should have got off with marrying her, and afterward
ridding me of her, as I could.” And these be the risks
poor maids and wives have to run, whether they be in the
right o’t or the wrong!</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I did</span> one time know a lady of very high rank
which did actually find herself pregnant by
the act of a very brave and gallant Prince;[66]
’twas said however the thing was done under
promise of marriage, though later the contrary was ascertained
to be the case. King Henri was the first to
learn the facts, and was sore vexed thereat, for she was
remotely connected with his Majesty. Any way, without
making any further noise or scandal about the matter,
he did the same evening at the Royal ball, chose her
as his partner and lead her out to dance the
<span class="no-wrap">torch-dance<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span>
with him; and afterward did make her dance with another
the <i>galliard</i> and the rest of the “brawls,” wherein she did
display her readiness and dexterity better than ever,
while her figure had all its old grace and was so well
arranged for the occasion as that she gave no sign of her
bigness. The end was that the King, who had kept his
eyes fixed on her very strictly all the time, did perceive
naught, no more than if she had not been with child at
all, and did presently observe to a great nobleman, one
of his chief familiars: “The folk were most ill-advised
and spiteful to have gone about to invent the tale that
yonder poor girl was big with child; never have I seen
her in better grace. The spiteful authors of the calumny
have told a most wicked falsehood.” Thus this good
King did shield the noble lady and poor girl, and did repeat
the same thing to his Queen whenas he was to bed
with her that night. But the latter, mistrusting the thing,
did have her examined the next morning, herself being
present, and she was found to be six months gone in pregnancy;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
after she did confess and avow the whole truth to
the Queen, saying ’twas done under pretence of marriage
to follow. Natheless the King, who was all good nature,
had the secret kept as close as ever possible, so as not to
bring shame and scandal on the damsel, though the Queen
for her part was very wrathful. Any way, they did send
her off very quietly to the home of her nearest kinsfolk,
where she was presently brought to bed of a fine boy.
Yet was the lad so unfortunate that he could never get
him recognized by his putative father; the trial of the
case did drag out to great length, but the mother could
never get aught decided in her favour.</p>

<p>Now good King Henri did love merry tales as well as
any of his predecessors, but he would never have scandal
brought on ladies therein nor their secrets divulged. In
fact, the King himself, who was of amorous complexion
enough, when he was away to visit the ladies, would ever
go thither stealthily and under cover all ever he could,
to the end they might be free of suspicion and ill-repute.
But an if there was any that was discovered, ’twas never
by his fault or with his consent, but rather by the fair
dame’s doing. So have I heard of one lady of the sort,
of a good house, named Madame
<span class="no-wrap">Flamin,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67*]</a></span>
a Scotswoman,
which being gotten with child by the King, did make no
sort of secret of it, but would say it out boldly in her
French Scotch thus: “I hae dune what I could, sae that
the noo, God be thankit, I am wi’ bairn by the King,
whilk doth mak me an honoured and unco happy woman.
And I maun say the blude Royal hath in it something
of a more douce and tasty humour than the ordinar, I
do find myself in sic gude case,—no to speak of the fine
bits o’ presents forthcoming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>Her <span class="no-wrap">son,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68*]</a></span>
that she had presently, was the late Grand
Prior of France, who was killed lately at Marseilles,—a
sore pity, for he was a very honourable, brave and gallant
nobleman, and did show the same clearly at his death.
Moreover he was a man of property and sense, and the
least tyrannical Governor of a District of his own day
or since. Provence could tell us that, and beside that he
was a right magnificent Seigneur and of a generous expenditure.
He was indeed a man of means, good sense and
wise moderation.</p>

<p>The said lady, with others I have heard of, held the
opinion that to lie with one’s Sovereign was no disgrace;
those be harlots indeed which do abandon their bodies to
petty folk, but not where great Kings and gallant gentlemen
be in question. Like that Queen of the Amazons I
have named above, which came a journey of three hundred
leagues for to be gotten with child by Alexander the
Great, to have good issue therefrom. Yet there be those
who say one man is as good as another for this!</p>

<p>After King Henri came Francis II., whose reign however
was so short as that spiteful folks had no time even
to begin speaking ill of ladies. Not that we are to believe,
if he had enjoyed a long reign, that he would have
suffered aught of the kind at his Court; for he was a
monarch naturally good-natured, frank, and not one to
take pleasure in scandal, as well as being most respectful
toward ladies and very ready to pay them all honour.
Beside he had the Queen his wife and the Queen his mother,
and his good uncles to boot, all of which were much for
checking these chatterers and loose-tongued gentry. I
remember me how once, the King being at Saint-Germain
en Laye, about the month of August or September, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
fancy took him one evening to go see the stags in their
rut in that noble forest of Saint-Germain, and he did
take with him certain princes, his chief familiars, and
some great ladies, both wives and maids, whose names I
could very well give, an if I chose. Nor was there lacking
one fain to make a talk of it, and say this did not smack
of his womankind being exactly virtuous or chaste, to be
going to see these lovemakings and wanton ruttings of
beasts, seeing how the appetite of Venus must heat them
more and more at sight of such doings. In fact, so sore
will they be longing to taste, that sure the water or saliva
will be coming to their mouth, in such wise that no other
remedy will there be thereafter for to get rid of the same
except only by some other discharge of saliva, or something
else. The King heard of this speech, and the noblemen
and ladies which had accompanied him thither. Be
well assured, an if the gentleman had not straightway
decamped, he had fared very ill; nor did he ever again
appear at Court till after that King’s death and the end
of his reign. Many scandalous pamphlets there were put
forth against them which were then in direction of the
Government of the Kingdom; but there was never an one
that did so hurt and offend as a satire entitled
<i>The</i> <span class="no-wrap"><i>Tiger</i><a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span>—modelled
on the first invective of Cicero against Catiline,—especially
as it spake freely of the amours of a
very great and fair lady, and a great nobleman, her kinsman.
An if the gallant author had been caught, though
he had had an hundred thousand lives, he had surely lost
them every one; for the two great folks, lady and gentleman,
were so exceeding vexed and angered as that they
did all but die of despair.</p>

<p>This King Francis II. was not subject to love like his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
predecessors; and truly he would have been greatly to
blame, seeing he had to wife the fairest woman in all the
world and the most amiable. And when a man hath such
a wife, he doth not go seeking fortune elsewhere as others
use, else is he a wretch indeed. And not so going, little
recks he to speak ill of ladies, or indeed to speak well
either, or to speak at all about them, except always of
his own good lady at home. ’Tis a doctrine I have heard
a very honourable personage maintain: natheless have I
known it prove false more than once.</p>

<p>King Charles came next to the throne, which by reason
of the tenderness of his years, did pay no heed at the
beginning of his reign to the ladies, but did rather give
his thoughts to spending his time in youthful sports and
exercises. Yet did the late deceased M. de Sipierre his
Governour and <span class="no-wrap">Tutor,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70*]</a></span>
a man who was in my opinion
and in that of every one else, the most honourable and
most courteous gentleman of his time, and the most gentle
and respectful toward women, did so well teach the same
lesson to the King his master and pupil, as that he was
as ready to honour ladies as any of the kings his predecessors.
For never, whether as boy or man, did he see a
woman, no matter how busied he was in other matters,
whether he was hurrying on or standing still, on foot or
on horse-back, but he would straight salute the same and
most respectfully doff his cap. Whenas he came to an
age for love, he did serve several very honourable dames
and damsels I have known of, but all this with so great
honour and respect as that he might have been the humblest
gentleman of the Court.</p>

<p>In his reign the great lampoonists did first begin their
vogue, and amongst them even some very gallant gentlemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
of the Court, whose names I will not give, did
strangely abuse the ladies, both in general and in particular,
and even some of the greatest in the land. For this
some of them have found themselves entangled in downright
fierce quarrels, and have come off second best,—not
indeed that they did avow the truth, for they did rather
always deny they had aught to do with it. If they had
confessed, they had had heavy payment to make, and the
King would certainly have let them feel the weight of his
displeasure, inasmuch as they did attack ladies of over
high a rank. Others did show the best face they could,
and did suffer the lie to be cast in their teeth a thousand
times over, conditionally as we may say and vaguely, and
had to swallow a thousand affronts, drinking the same in
as sweetly as though they had been milk, without daring
to retort one word, else had their lives been at risk. ’Tis
a thing which hath oft given me great surprise that suchlike
folks should set them to speak ill of their neighbours,
yet suffer others to speak ill of themselves so sorely and
to their very face. Yet had these men the repute of being
gallant swordsmen; but in this matter they would
aye endure all but the extremest insult bravely and without
one word of protest.</p>

<p>I do remember me of a lampoon which was made against
a very great lady, a widow, fair and of most honourable
birth, which did desire to marry again with a very great
Prince, a young and handsome
<span class="no-wrap">man.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span>
There were certain
persons, (and I have accurate knowledge of the same),
who disliking this marriage, and to dissuade the Prince
therefrom, did concoct a lampoon on her, the most scandalous
I have ever seen, in the which they did compare
her to five or six of the chiefest harlots of Antiquity, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the most notorious and wanton, declaring how that she
did overtop them each and all. The actual authors of
the said satire did present it to the Prince, professing
however that it did emanate from others, and that themselves
had merely been given it. The Prince, having
looked at it, gave the lie to its statements and hurled a
thousand vague and general insults at them which had
writ it; yet did they pass all over in silence, brave and
valiant men though they were. The incident however did
give the Prince pause a while, seeing the lampoon did contain
several definite revelations and point direct at some
unpleasant facts; natheless after the lapse of two years
more was the marriage accomplished.</p>

<p>The King was so great-hearted and kindly that he was
never inclined to favour folks of this kidney. To pass a
spicy word or two with them aside, this he did like well
enough; but he was always most unwilling the common
herd should be fed on such diet, declaring that his Court,
which was the best ennobled and most illustrious by reason
of great and noble ladies of any in all the world,
should never, such being its high repute, be cheapened
and foully aspersed by the mouth of suchlike reckless and
insolent babblers. ’Twas well enough to speak so of the
courtesans of Rome, or Venice, or other the like places,
but not of the Court of France; it might be permitted to
do the thing, it was not permitted to speak thereof.</p>

<p>Thus do we see how this Sovereign was ever respectful
toward ladies, nay! so much so that in his later days when
some I know of were fain to give him an evil impression of
certain very great, as well as most fair and honourable
dames, for that these had intermeddled in some highly
important matters of his concern, yet would he never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
credit aught against them; but did accord them as good
favour as ever, dying at the last in their very good graces
and with many a tear of their shedding to wet his corpse.
And they did find good cause to say so too, so soon as
ever King Henri III. came to succeed him, who by reason
of sundry ill reports he had been told of these ladies when
in Poland, did not make near so much of them as he had
done aforetime. Both over these and over some others
that I know of, he did exercise a very strict censorship,
and one we may be sure that made him not more liked; and
indeed I do believe they did him no little hurt, and contributed
in part to his evil fortune and final ruin. I
could allege sundry special facts in proof hereof, but I
had rather pass them over,—saying only this much, that
women generally are keen set on taking vengeance. It
may be long in coming, but they do execute it at the
<span class="no-wrap">last.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72*]</a></span>
On the contrary many men’s revenge is just the opposite
in its nature, for ardent and hot enough at its first beginning
to deceive all, yet by dint of temporising and putting
off and long delays it doth grow cool and come to naught.
And this is why ’tis meet to guard against the first attempt,
and take time by the forelock in parrying the
blows; but with women the first fury and attempt, and the
temporising and delay, do both last out to the end,—that
is in some women, though hardly many.</p>

<p>Some have been for excusing the King for the war he
made on women in the way of crying them down, by saying
’twas in order to curb and correct vice,—as if the
curb were of any of the slightest use in these cases, seeing
woman is so conditioned of nature as that the more this
thing is forbid her, the more ardent is she after the same,
and to set a watch on her is just labour lost. So in actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
fact myself have seen how, for all he could do, they were
never turned out of their natural road.</p>

<p>Several ladies that I wot well enough, did he love and
serve with all due respect and very high honour,—and
even a certain very great and fair
<span class="no-wrap">Princess,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span>
of whom he
had fallen so deep in love before his going into Poland,
that after he became King, he did resolve to wed the same,
although she was already married to a great and gallant
Prince, but one that was in rebellion against him and had
fled to a foreign land to gather an army and make war
upon him. But at the moment of his return to France,
the lady died in child-birth. Her death alone did hinder
the marriage, for he was firm set thereon. He would certainly
have married her by favour and dispensation of
the Pope, who would not have refused him his consent,
being so great a Monarch as he was, and for sundry other
reasons that may be readily imagined.</p>

<p>Others again he did make love to only for to bring the
same into disparagement. Of such I wot of one, a great
lady, in whose case, for the displeasures her husband had
wrought him, and not able otherwise to get at him, the
King did take his revenge on his wife, whom he did after
publish abroad for what she was in the presence of a
number of folk. Yet was this vengeance mild and merciful
after all, for in lieu of death he did give her life.</p>

<p>Another I wot of, which for overmuch playing the wanton,
as also for a displeasure she did the King, the latter
did of set purpose pay court to. Anon without any vast
deal of persuasion, she did grant him an assignation in a
garden, the which he failed not to keep. But he would
have naught else to do with her (so some folk say, but be
sure he did find something to do with her right enough)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
but only to have her so seen offering herself in open market,
and then to banish her from the Court with ignominy.</p>

<p>He was anxious and exceeding inquisitive to know the
life of all and every fair lady of his Court, and to penetrate
their secret wishes. ’Tis said he did sometimes reveal
one or other of his successes with women to sundry
of his most privy intimates. Happy they! for sure the
leavings of suchlike great monarchs must needs be very
tasty morsels.</p>

<p>The ladies did fear him greatly, as I have myself seen.
He would either reprimand them personally, when needful,
or else beg the Queen his mother so to do, who on her
part was ready enough at the work. ’Twas not however
that she did favour scandal-mongers, as I have shown
above in the little examples I have there given. And paying
such heed as she did to these and showing so great
displeasure against them, what was she not bound to do
others which did actually compromise the good name and
honour of her ladies?</p>

<p>This monarch again was so well accustomed from his
earliest years, as myself have seen, to hear tales of ladies
and their gallantries (and truly myself have told him one
or two such), and to repeat them too,—yet alway in
secret, for fear the Queen his mother should learn thereof,
for she would never have him tell such stories to any
others than herself, that she might check the same,—so
well accustomed was he to all this, that coming to riper
years and full liberty, he did never lose the habit. And
in this wise he did know how they did all live at his Court
and in his Kingdom,—or at the least many of them, and
especially the great ladies of rank, as well as if he had
frequented them every one. And if any there were which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
were new come to Court, accosting these most courteously
and respectfully, yet would he tell them over such tales
as that they would be utterly amazed at heart to know
where he had gotten all his information, though all the
while denying and protesting against the whole budget to
his face. And if he did divert himself after this fashion,
yet did he not fail, in other and more weighty matters, to
apply his visit to such high purpose as that folk have
counted him the greatest King which for an hundred
years hath been in France, as I have writ elsewhere in a
chapter composed expressly upon this
<span class="no-wrap">Sovereign.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly I do now say no more about him, albeit it
may be objected to me that I have been but chary of examples
of his character on this point, and that I should
say more, an if I be so well informed. Yea! truly, I do
know tales enough, and some of them high-spiced; but I
wish not to be a mere chronicler of news whether of the
Court or of the world at large. Beside, I could never
cloak and cover up these my tales so featly but that folk
would see through them, and scandal come therefrom.</p>

<p>Now these traducers of fair ladies be of divers sorts.
Some do speak ill of women for some displeasure these
have done them, though all the while they be as chaste as
any in all the world, and instead of the pure and beauteous
angel they really resemble do make out a picture
of a devil all foul and ugly with wickedness. Thus an
honourable gentleman I have both seen and known, did
most abominably defame a very honourable and virtuous
lady for a slight affront she had put upon him, and did
sorely wreak his displeasure on her. He would say thus:
“I know quite well I am in the wrong, and do not deny
the lady to be really most chaste and virtuous. But be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
it who it may, the woman which shall have affronted me
in the smallest degree, though she were as chaste and pure
as the Blessed Virgin herself, seeing I can in no other way
bring her to book, as I would with a man, I will say every
evil gallows thing I can think of concerning her.” Yet
surely God will be angered at such a wretch.</p>

<p>Other traducers there be, which loving ladies and failing
to overcome their virtue and get aught out of them,
do of sheer despite proclaim them public wantons. Nay!
they will do yet worse, saying openly they have had their
will of them, but having known them and found them too
exceeding lustful, have for this cause left them. Myself
have known many gentlemen of this complexion at our
French Kings’ Courts. Then again there is the case of
women quitting right out their pretty lovers and bed
favourites, but who presently, following the dictates of
their fickleness and inconstancy, grow sick again and
enamoured of others in their stead; whereupon these same
lovers, in despite and despair, do malign and traduce
these poor women, there is no saying how bitterly, going
so far even as to relate detail by detail their naughtinesses
and wanton tricks which they have practised together,
and to make known their blemishes which they have on
their naked bodies, to win the better credence to their tale.</p>

<p>Other men there be which, in despite because ladies do
give to others what they refuse to them, do malign them
with might and main, and have them watched and spied
upon and observed, to the end they may afford the world
the greater signs and proofs of their true speaking.</p>

<p>Others again there be, which, fairly stung with jealousy,
without other cause than this, do speak ill of those
men whom women love the most, and of the very women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
whom they themselves love fondly until they see their
faults fully revealed. And this is one of the chiefest effects
of jealousy. Yet are such traducers not so sore to
blame as one would at first say they were; for this their
fault must be set down to love and jealousy; twin brother
and sister of one and the same birth.</p>

<p>Other traducers there be which are so born and bred to
backbiting, as that rather than not backbite some one or
other, they will speak ill of their own selves. Now, think
you ’tis likely ladies’ honour will be spared in the mouth
of folks of this kidney? Many suchlike have I seen at the
Courts of our Kings, which being afeared to speak of men
by reason of their sword play, would raise up scandal
around the petticoats of poor weak women, which have
no other means of reprisal but tears, regrets and empty
words. Yet have I known not a few which have come off
very ill at this game; for there have been kinsmen, brothers,
friends, lovers of theirs, even husbands, which have
made many repent of their spite, and eat and swallow
down their foul words.</p>

<p>Finally, did I but tell of all the diverse sorts of detractors
of ladies, I should never have done.</p>

<p>An opinion I have heard many maintain as to love is
this: that a love kept secret is good for naught, an if it
be not in some degrees manifest,—if not to all, at the least
to a man’s most privy friends. But an if it cannot be
told to all, yet at the least must some show be made
thereof, whether by display of favours, wearing of fair
ladies’ liveries and colours, or acts of knightly prowess,
as tiltings at the ring, tourneys, mascarades, fights in the
lists, even to fights in good earnest when at the wars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Verily the content of a man is great at these satisfactions.</p>

<p>For to tell truth, what would it advantage a great Captain
to have done a fine and signal exploit of war, if not
a word were said and naught known thereof? I ween
’twould be a mortal vexation to him. The like would
rightly seem to be the case with lovers which do love
nobly,—as some at any rate maintain. And of this opinion
was that prince of lovers, M. de Nemours, the paragon
of all knighthood; for truly if ever Prince, great
Lord or simple gentleman, hath been fortunate in love,
’twas he. He found no pleasure in hiding his successes
from his most privy friends, albeit from the general he
did keep the same so secret, as that only with much difficulty
could folk form a judgment thereanent.</p>

<p>In good sooth, for married ladies is the revealing of
such matters highly dangerous. On the other hand for
maids and widows, which are to marry, ’tis of no account;
for that the cloak and pretext of a future marriage doth
cover up all sins.</p>

<p>I once knew a very honourable gentleman at
<span class="no-wrap">Court,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75*]</a></span>
which being lover of a very great lady, and finding himself
one day in company of a number of his comrades in discourse
as to their mistresses, and agreeing together to
reveal the favours received of them to each other, the said
gentleman did all through refuse to declare his mistress,
and did even feign quite another lady to be his dear, and
so threw dust in their eyes,—and this although there was
present in the group a great Prince, which did conjure
him to tell the truth, having yet some suspicion of the
secret intrigue he was engaged in. But neither he nor his
companions could draw anything more out of him, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
in his inmost heart he did curse his fate an hundred
times over, which had so constrained him not to reveal,
like the rest of them, his success and triumph, ever more
sweet to tell of than defeat.</p>

<p>Another I once knew, and a right gallant gentleman,
by reason of his presumption and overmuch freedom of
speech in proclaiming of his mistress’ name, the which he
should have held sacred, as much by signs and tokens as
by actual words, did come parlous near his death in a
murderous attack he but barely escaped from. Yet afterward
on another count he did not so escape the assassins’
swords, but did presently die of the hurt they gave him.</p>

<p>Myself was at Court in the time of King Francis II.
when the Comte de Saint-Aignan did wed at Fontainebleau
with young Madame la
<span class="no-wrap">Bourdaisière.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span>
Next day, the
bridegroom having come into the King’s apartment, each
and all of the courtiers present did begin to vent their
japes on him. Amongst others a certain great Lord and
very gallant soldier did ask him how many stages he had
made. The husband replied five. As it fell out, there
was also there present an honourable gentleman, a Secretary,
which was then in the very highest favour with a
very great Princess, whose name I will not give, who hereupon
declared,—’twas nothing much, considering the fair
road he had travelled and the fine weather he had, for it
was summer-time. The great Lord then said to him,
“Ho! my fine fellow, you’ld be for having birds enough
to your bag, it seems!”—“And prithee, why not?” retorted
the Secretary. “By God! why! I have taken a
round dozen in four and twenty hours on the most fairest
meadow is in all this neighbourhood, or can be anywhere
in all France.” Who more astounded than the said Lord,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
who did learn by these words a thing he had longwhile
suspected? And seeing that himself was deep in love with
this same Princess, he was exceeding mortified to think
how he had so long hunted in this quarter without ever
getting aught, whereas the other had been so lucky in his
sport. This the Lord did dissimulate for the moment;
but later, after long brooding over his resentment, he had
paid him back hot and strong in his own coin but for a
certain consideration that I prefer not to mention. Yet
did he ever after bear him a secret grudge. Indeed, an
if the Secretary had been really well advised, he would
never have so boasted of his bag, but would rather have
kept the thing very secret, especially in so high and brilliant
an adventure, whereof trouble and scandal were exceeding
like to arise.</p>

<p>What should we say of a certain gentleman of the great
world, which for some displeasure his mistress had done
him, was so insolent as that he went and showed her
husband the lady’s portrait, which she had given him, and
which he carried hung at his neck. The husband did exhibit
no small astonishment, and thereafter showed him
less loving toward his wife, who yet did contrive to gloze
over the matter as well as she could.</p>

<p>Still more to blame was a great Lord I wot of, who disgusted
at some trick his mistress had played on him, did
stake her portrait at dice and lose it to one of his soldiers,
for he was in command of a large company of infantry.
Hearing thereof, the lady came nigh bursting with vexation,
and was exceeding angered. The Queen Mother did
presently hear of it, and did reprimand him for what he
had done, on the ground that the scorn put on her was
far too extreme, so to go and abandon to the chance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the dice the portrait of a fair and honourable lady. But
the Lord did soon set the matter in a better light, declaring
how that in his hazard, he had kept back the
parchment inside, and had staked only the box encasing
the same, which was of gold and enriched with precious
stones. Myself have many a time heard the tale discussed
between the lady and the said Lord in right merry wise,
and have whiles laughed my fill thereat.</p>

<p>Hereanent will I say one thing: to wit, that there be
ladies,—and myself have known sundry such,—which in
their loves do prefer to be defied, threatened, and eke
bullied; and a man will in this fashion have his way with
them better far than by gentle dealings and complacencies.
Just as with fortresses, some be taken by sheer
force of arms, others by gentler means. Yet will no
women endure to be reviled and cried out upon as whores;
for such words be more offensive to them than the things
they do represent.</p>

<p>Sulla would never forgive the city of Athens, nor refrain
from the utter overthrow of the same root and branch,
not by reason of the obstinacy of its defence against him,
but solely because from the top of the walls thereof the
citizens had foully abused his wife Metella and touched
her honour to the
<span class="no-wrap">quick.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77*]</a></span></p>

<p>In certain quarters, the which I will not name, the soldiery
in skirmishes and sieges of fortified places were
used, the one side against the other, to cast reproach
upon the virtue of two of their sovereign Princesses, going
so far as to cry forth one to the other: “Your Princess
doth play ninepins fine and well!”—“And yours is downright
good at a main too!” By dint of these aspersions
and bywords were the said Princesses cause of rousing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
them to do havoc and commit cruelties more than any
other reason whatever, as I have myself seen.</p>

<p>I have heard it related how that the chiefest motive
which did most animate the Queen of
<span class="no-wrap">Hungary<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78*]</a></span>
to light
up those her fierce fires of rage about Picardy and other
regions of France was to revenge sundry insolent and
foul-mouthed gossips, which were forever telling of her
amours, and singing aloud through all the countryside the
refrain:</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Cato</span> could never stomach Cæsar from that
day when in the Senate, which was deliberating
as to measures against Catiline and his
conspiracy, Cæsar being much suspected of
being privy to the plot, there was brought in to the latter
under the rose a little packet, or more properly speaking
a <i>billet doux</i>, the which Servilia, Cato’s sister, did send
for to fix an assignation and meeting place. Cato now
no more doubting of the complicity of Cæsar with Catiline,
did cry out loud that the Senate should order him
to show the communication in question. Thus constrained,
Cæsar made the said letter public, wherein the
honour of the other’s sister was brought into sore scandal
and open disrepute. I leave you then to imagine if
Cato, for all the fine airs he did affect of hating Cæsar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
for the Republic’s sake, could ever come to like him, in
view of this most compromising incident. Yet was it no
fault of Cæsar’s, for he was bound to show the letter, and
that on risk of his life. And I ween Servilia bare him no
special ill-will for this; for in fact and deed they ceased
not to carry on still their loving intercourse, whereof
sprang Brutus, whose father Cæsar was commonly reputed
to have been. If so, he did but ill requite his parent
for having given him being.</p>

<p>True it is, ladies in giving of themselves to great men,
do run many risks; and if they do win of the same favours,
and high privileges and much wealth, yet do they buy all
these at a great price.</p>

<p>I have heard tell of a very fair lady, honourable and of
a good house, though not of so great an one as a certain
great Lord, who was deep in love with her. One day
having found the lady in her chamber alone with her
women, and seated on her bed, after some converse betwixt
them and sundry conceits concerning love, the Lord
did proceed to kiss the lady and did by gentle constraint
lay her down upon the bed. Anon coming to the main
issue, and she enduring that same with quiet, civil firmness,
she did say thus to him: “’Tis a strange thing how you
great Lords cannot refrain you from using your authority
and privileges upon us your inferiors. At the least,
if only silence were as common with you as is freedom of
speech, you would be but too desirable and excusable. I
do beg you therefore, Sir! to hold secret what you do,
and keep mine honour safe.”</p>

<p>Such be the words customarily employed by ladies of
inferior station to their superiors. “Oh! my Lord,” they
cry, “think at any rate of mine honour.” Others say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
“Ah! my dear Lord, an if you speak of this, I am undone;
in Heaven’s name safeguard mine honour.” Others
again, “Why! my good Lord! if only you do say never a
word and mine honour be safe, I see no great objection,”
as if wishing to imply thereby a man may do what he
please, an if it be in secret. So other folk know naught
about it, they deem themselves in no wise dishonoured.</p>

<p>Ladies of higher rank and more proud station do say
to their gallants, if inferior to themselves: “Be you exceeding
careful not to breathe one word of the thing, no
matter how small. Else it is a question of your life; I
will have you thrown in a sack into the water, or assassinated,
or hamstrung;” such and suchlike language do
they hold. In fact there is never a lady, of what rank
soever she be, that will endure to be evil spoke of or her
good name discussed however slightly in the Palace or in
men’s mouths. Yet are there some others which be so ill-advised,
or desperate, or entirely carried away of love,
as that without men bringing any charge against them,
they do traduce their own selves. Of such sort was, no
long while agone, a very fair and honourable lady, of a
good house, with the which a great Lord did fall deep in
love, and presently enjoying her favours, did give her a
very handsome and precious bracelet. This she was so
ill-advised as to wear commonly on her naked arm above
the elbow. But one day her husband, being to bed with
her, did chance to discover the same; and examining it,
found matter enough therein to cause him to rid him of
her by a violent death. A very foolish and ill-advised
woman truly!</p>

<p>I knew at another time a very great and sovereign
Prince who after keeping true to a mistress, one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
fairest ladies of the Court, by the space of three years,
at the end of that time was obliged to go forth on an
expedition for to carry out some conquest. Before starting,
he did of a sudden fall deep in love with a very fair
and honourable Princess, if ever there was one. Then
for to show her he had altogether quitted his former mistress
for her sake, and wishing to honour and serve her
in every way, without giving a second thought to the
memory of his old love, he did give her before leaving all
the favours, jewels, rings, portraits, bracelets and other
such pretty things which his former mistress had given
him. Some of these being seen and noted of her, she came
nigh dying of vexation and despite; yet did she not refrain
from divulging the matter; for if only she could
bring ill repute on her rival, she was ready to suffer the
same scandal herself. I do believe, had not the said Princess
died some while after, that the Prince, on his coming
back from abroad, would surely have married her.</p>

<p>I knew yet another
<span class="no-wrap">Prince,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span>
though not so great an one,
which during his first wife’s lifetime and during his widowhood,
did come to love a very fair and honourable damsel
of the great world, to whom he did make, in their courting
and love time, most beautiful presents, neck-chains,
rings, jewels and many other fine ornaments, and amongst
others a very fine and richly framed mirror wherein was
set his own portrait. Well! presently this same Prince
came to wed a very fair and honourable Princess of the
great world, who did make him lose all taste for his first
mistress, albeit neither fell aught below the other for
beauty. The Princess did then so work upon and strongly
urge the Prince her husband, as that he did anon send to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
demand back of his former mistress all he had ever given
her of fairest and most rich and rare.</p>

<p>This was a very sore chagrin to the lady; yet was she
of so great and high an heart, albeit she was no Princess,
though of one of the best houses in France, as that she
did send him back all that was most fair and exquisite,
wherein was a beautiful mirror with the picture of the
said Prince. But first, for to decorate the same still better,
she did take a pen and ink, and did scrawl inside a
great pair of horns for him right in the mid of the forehead.
Then handing the whole to the gentleman, the
Prince’s messenger, she spake thuswise to him: “Here,
my friend, take this to your master, and tell him I do
hereby send him back all he ever gave me, and that I have
taken away nor added naught, unless it be something he
hath himself added thereto since. And tell yonder fair
Princess, his wife, which hath worked on him so strongly
to demand back all his presents of me, that if a certain
great Lord (naming him by name, and myself do know
who it was) had done the like by her mother, and had
asked back and taken from her what he had many a time
and oft given her for sleeping with him, by way of love
gifts and amorous presents, she would be as poor in gewgaws
and jewels as ever a young maid at Court. Tell
her, that for her own head, the which is now so loaded at
the expense of this same Lord and her mother’s belly, she
would then have to go scour the gardens every morning
for to pluck flowers to deck it withal, instead of jewelry.
Well! let her e’en make what show and use she will of
them; I do freely give them up to her.” Any which hath
known this fair lady will readily understand she was such
an one as to have said as much; and herself did tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
she did, and very free of speech she aye was. Yet could
she not fail but feel it sore, whether from husband or
wife, to be so ill treated and deceived. And the Princess
was blamed of many folk, which said ’twas her own fault,
to have so despitefully used and driven her to desperation
the poor lady, the which had well earned such presents
by the sweat of her body.</p>

<p>This lady, for that she was one of the most beautiful
and agreeable women of her time, failed not, notwithstanding
she had so sacrificed her virtue to this Prince, to
make a good marriage with a very rich man, though not
her equal in family. So one day, the twain being come to
mutual reproaches as to the honour they had done each
the other in marrying, and she making a point of the high
estate she was of and yet had married him, he did retort,
“Nay! but I have done more for you than you have done
for me; for I have dishonoured myself for to recover
your honour for you;” meaning to infer by this that,
whereas she had lost hers when a girl, he had won it back
for her, by taking her to wife.</p>

<p>I have heard tell, and I ween on good authority, how
that, after King Francis I. had quitted Madame de Chasteaubriand,
his most favourite mistress, to take Madame
d’Etampes, Helly by her maiden name, whom the Queen
Regent had chosen for one of her Maids of Honour and
did bring to the King’s notice on his return from Spain
to Bordeaux,—and he did take her for his mistress, and
left the aforesaid Madame de Chasteaubriand, as they
say one nail doth drive out another,—his new mistress
Madame d’Etampes, did beg the King to have back from
the Chasteaubriand all the best jewels which he had given
her. Now this was in no wise for the price or value of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
same, for in those days pearls and precious stones had not
the vogue they have since gotten, but for liking of the
graceful
<span class="no-wrap">mottoes<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80*]</a></span>
which had been set, imprinted and engraven
thereon, the which the Queen of Navarre, his sister,
had made and composed; for she was a past mistress
of this art. So King Francis did grant her prayer, and
promising he would do this, was as good as his word. To
this end he did send one of his gentlemen to her for to
demand their return, but she on the instant did feign herself
sick and appointed the gentleman to come again in
three days’ time, when he should have what he craved.
Meantime, in her despite, she did send for a goldsmith,
and had him melt down all the jewels, without any regard
or thought of the dainty devices which were engraven
thereon. Then anon, when the messenger was returned,
she did give him all the ornaments converted and changed
into gold ingots. “Go, carry this,” she said, “to the
King, and tell him that, as it hath pleased his Majesty
to ask back what he did erst so generously give me, I do
now return and send back the same in gold ingots. As
for the mottoes and devices, these I have so well conned
over and imprinted on my mind, and do hold them so
dear, as that I could in no wise suffer any other should
use or enjoy the same and have delight therein but myself.”</p>

<p>When the King had received the whole, ingots and message
and all, he made no other remark but only this,
“Nay! give her back the whole. What I was for doing,
’twas not for the worth of the gold (for I would have
gladly given her twice as much), but for liking of the
devices and mottoes; but seeing she hath so destroyed
these, I care not for the gold, and do return it her again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Herein hath she shown more greatness and boldness of
heart than ever I had dreamed could come of a woman.”
A noble-spirited lady’s heart, chagrined so and scorned,
is capable of great things.</p>

<p>These Princes which do so recall their presents act much
otherwise than did once Madame de Nevers, of the house
of Bourbon, daughter of M. de
<span class="no-wrap">Montpensier.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81*]</a></span>
This same
was in her day a very prudent, virtuous and beautiful
Princess, and held for such both in France and Spain, in
which latter country she had been brought up along with
Queen Elisabeth of France, being her cup-bearer and
giving her to drink; for it must be known this Queen was
aye served by her gentlewomen, dames and damsels, and
each had her rank and office, the same as we Courtiers in
attendance on our Kings. This Princess was married to
the Comte d’Eu, eldest son of M. de Nevers, she worthy of
him as he was right well worthy of her, being one of the
handsomest and most pleasing Princes of his time. For
which cause was he much loved and sought after of many
fair and noble ladies of the Court, amongst others of one
which was both this, and a very adroit and clever woman
to boot. Now it befell one day that the Prince did take
a ring from off his wife’s finger, a very fine one, a diamond
worth fifteen hundred or mayhap two thousand crowns,
the which the Queen of Spain had given her on her quitting
her Court. This ring the Prince, seeing how his mistress
did admire it greatly and did show signs of coveting its
possession, being very free-handed and generous, did
frankly offer her, giving her to understand he had won the
same at tennis. Nor did she refuse the gift, but taking
it as a great mark of affection, did always wear it on her
finger for love of him. And thus Madame de Nevers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
who did understand from her good husband that he had
lost the ring at tennis, or at any rate that it was lying
pawned, came presently to see the same on the hand of her
rival, whom she was quite well aware was her husband’s
mistress. Yet was she so wise and prudent and had such
command of herself, as that, merely changing colour
somewhat and quietly dissembling her chagrin, without any
more ado she did turn her head another way, and did
breathe never a word of the matter either to her husband
or his mistress. Herein was she much to be commended,
for that she did show no cross-grained, vixenish temper,
nor anger, nor yet expose the younger lady to public
scorn, as not a few others I wot of would have done, thus
delighting the company and giving them occasion for gossip
and scandal-mongering.</p>

<p>Thus we see how necessary is moderation in such matters
and how excellent a thing, as also that here no less than
elsewhere doth luck and ill-luck prevail. For some ladies
there be which cannot take one step aside or make the very
smallest stumble in the path of virtue, or taste of love but
with the tip of their finger, but lo! they be instantly traduced,
exposed and satirized right and left.</p>

<p>Others again there be which do sail full before the wind
over the sea and pleasant waters of Venus, and with naked
body and wide spread limbs do swim with wide strokes
therein, wantoning in its waves, voyaging toward Cyprus
and the Temple of Venus there and her gardens, and taking
their fill of delight in love; yet deuce a word doth any say
about them, no more than if they had never been born.
Thus doth fortune favour some and mislike others in matter
of scandal-making; myself have seen not a few examples
thereof in my day, and some be found still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>

<p>In the time of King Charles was writ a lampoon at
Fontainebleau, most base and scurrilous, wherein the fellow
did spare neither the Royal Princesses nor the very greatest
ladies nor any others. And verily, an if the true
author had been known, he would have found himself
in very ill case.</p>

<p>At Blois moreover, whenas the marriage of the Queen
of Navarre was arranged with the King, her husband, was
made yet another, against a very great and noble lady,
and a most scurrilous one, whereof the author was never
discovered. But there were really some very brave and
valiant gentlemen mixed up therein, which however did
carry it off very boldly and made many loud general denials.
So many others beside were writ, as that naught
else was seen whether in this reign or in that of King
Henri III.—and above all one most scurrilous one in the
form of a song, and to the tune of a <i>coranto</i> which was
then commonly danced at Court, and hence came to be
sung among the pages and lackeys on every note, high and
low.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i_coloured16.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the days of our King Henri III. was a yet
worse thing done. A certain gentleman, whom
I have known both by name and person, did
one day make a present to his mistress of a
book of pictures, wherein were shown two and thirty ladies
of high or middling rank about the Court, painted in true
colours, a-bed and sporting with their lovers, who were
likewise represented and that in the most natural way.
Some had two or three lovers, some more, some less; and
these thirty-two ladies did figure forth more than seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
and twenty of the figures or <i>postures</i> of Aretino, and all
different. The actors were so well represented and so
naturally, as that they did seem actually to be speaking
and doing. While some were disrobed, other were shown
clad in the very same clothes, and with the same head-dresses,
ornaments and weeds as they were commonly
to be seen wearing. In a word, so cunningly was the book
wrought and painted that naught could be more curious;
and it had cost eight or nine hundred crowns, and was
illuminated throughout.</p>

<p>Now this lady did show it one day and lend it to another,
her comrade and bosom friend, which latter was
much a favourite and familiar of a great Lady that was
in the book, and one of the most vividly and vigorously represented
there; so seeing how much it concerned herself,
she did give her best attention. Then being curious of all
experience, she was fain to look it over with another, a
great lady, her cousin and chiefest friend, who had begged
her to afford her the enjoyment of the sight, and who was
likewise in the pictures, like the rest.</p>

<p>So the book was examined very curiously and with the
greatest care, leaf by leaf, without passing over a single
one lightly, so that they did spend two good hours of the
afternoon at the task. The fair ladies, far from being
annoyed or angered thereat, did find good cause for
mirth therein, seeing them to admire the pictures mightily,
and gaze at them fixedly.</p>

<p>These two dames were bolder and more valiant and
determined than one I have heard tell of, who one day
looking at this same book with two others of her friends, so
ravished with delight was she and did enter into such an
ecstasy of love and so burning a desire to imitate these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
same luscious pictures, as that she cannot see out of her
eyes till the fourth page, and at the fifth did fall in a
dead faint. A terrible swoon truly! very different to that
of Octavia, sister of Cæsar Augustus, who one day hearing
Virgil recite the three verses he had writ on her dead son
Marcellus (for which she did give him three thousand
crowns for the three alone) did incontinently swoon right
away. That was love indeed, but of how different a
sort!</p>

<p>I have heard tell, in the days when I was at Court, of
a great Prince of the highest rank, old and well stricken
in years, and who ever since the loss of his wife had borne
him very continently in his widowhood, as indeed was but
consistent with his high repute for sanctity of life. At
last he was fain to marry again with a very fair, virtuous
and young Princess. But seeing how for the ten years he
had been a widower he had never so much as touched a
woman, and fearing to have forgot the way of it (as
though it were an art that a man may forget), and to
get a rebuff the first night of his wedlock, and perform
naught of his desire, was anxious to make a previous essay.
So by dint of money he did win over a fair young maid, a
virgin like the wife he was to marry; nay more, ’tis said
he had her chosen to resemble somewhat in features his
future wife. Fortune was so kind to him that he did
prove he had by no means forgot as yet his old skill; and
his essay was so successful that, bold and happy, he did
advance to his wife’s fortress, and won good victory and
high repute.</p>

<p>This essay was more successful than that of another
gentleman whose name I have heard, whom his father,
although he was very young and much of a simpleton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
did desire should marry. Well! first of all he was for making
an essay, to know if he would be a good mate with his
wife; so for this end, some months aforehand, he did get
him a pretty-faced harlot, whom he made to come every
afternoon to his father’s warren, for ’twas summer-time,
where he did frisk and make sport with the damsel in the
freshness of the green trees and a gushing fountain in
such wise that he did perform wonders. Thus encouraged,
he feared no man, but was ready enough to play the like
bold part with his wife. But the worst of it was that when
the marriage night was come, and it was time to go with
his wife, lo! he cannot do a thing. Who so astonished
as the poor youth, and who so ready to cry out upon his
accursed recreant weapon, which had so missed fire in
the new spot where he now was. Finally plucking up his
courage, he said thus to his wife, “My pretty one, I cannot
tell what this doth mean, for every day I have done wonders
in the warren,” and so recounted over his deeds of
prowess to her. “Let us to sleep now, and my advice is,
to-morrow after dinner I will take you thither, and you
shall see very different sport.” This he did, and his wife
found him as good as his word. Hence the saying current
at Court, “Ha, ha! an if I had you in my father’s
warren, you should see what I would do!” We can only
suppose that the god of gardens, Dan Priapus, and the
fauns and wanton satyrs which haunt the woods, do there
aid good fellows and favour their deeds of prowess.</p>

<p>Yet are not all essays alike, nor do all end favorably.
For in matter of love, I have both seen and heard tell of
not a few good champions which have failed to remember
their lessons and keep their engagements when they came
to the chief task of all. For while some be either too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
hot or too cold, in such wise that these humours, of ice or
of fire, do take them of a sudden, others be lost in an
ecstasy to find so sovran a treat within their arms; others
again grow over fearful, others get instantly and totally
flaccid and impotent, without the least knowing the reason
why, and yet others find themselves actually paralysed.
In a word there be so many unexpected accidents
which may occur just at the wrong moment, that if I
were to tell them all, I should not have done for ages.
I can only refer me to many married folk and other amateurs
of love, who can say an hundred times more of all
this than I. Now such essays be good for the men, but
not for the women. Thus I have heard tell of a mother,
a lady of quality, who holding very dear an only daughter
she had, and having promised the same in marriage to
an honourable gentleman, avant que de l’y faire entrer
et craignant qu’elle ne pût souffrir ce premier et dur
effort, à quoi on disait le gentilhomme être très rude et
fort proportionné, elle la fit essayer premièrement par un
jeune page qu’elle avait, assez grandet, une douzaine de
fois, disant qu’il n’y avait que la première ouverture
fâcheuse à faire et que, se faisant un peu douce et petite
au commencement, qu’elle endurerait la grande plus
aisément; comme il advint, et qu’il y put avoir de l’apparence.
Cet essai est encore bien plus honnête et moins
scandaleux qu’un qui me fut dit une fois, en Italie, d’un
père qui avait marié son fils, qui était encore un jeune sot,
avec une fort belle fille à laquelle, tant fat qu’il était, il
n’avait rien pu faire ni la première ni la seconde nuit de
ses noces; et comme il eut demandé et au fils et à la nore
comme ils se trouvaient en mariage et s’ils avaient
triomphé, ils répondirent l’un et l’autre: “<i>Niente</i>.—A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
quoi a-t-il tenu?” demanda à son fils. Il répondit tout
follement qu’il ne savait comment il fallait faire. Sur
quoi il prit son fils par une main et la nore par une autre
et les mena tous deux en une chambre et leur dit: “Or
je vous veux donc montrer comme il faut faire.” Et fit
coucher sa nore sur un bout de lit, et lui fait bien élargir
les jambes, et puis dit à son fils: “Or vois comment je
fais,” et dit à sa nore: “Ne bougez, non importe, il n’y
a point de mal.” Et en mettant son membre bien arboré
dedans, dit: “Avise bien comme je fais et comme je dis,
<i>Dentro fuero, dentro fuero</i>,” et répliqua souvent ces deux
mots en s’avançant dedans et reculant, non pourtant tout
dehors. Et ainsi, après ces fréquentes agitations et
paroles, <i>dentro</i> et <i>fuero</i>, quand ce vint à la consommation,
il se mit à dire brusquement et vite: <i>Dentro, dentro,
dentro, dentro</i>, jusqu’à ce qu’il eût fait. Au diable le
mot de <i>fuero</i>. Et par ainsi, pensant faire du magister,
il fut tout à plat adultère de sa nore, laquelle, ou qu’elle
fit de la niaise ou, pour mieux dire, de la fine, s’en trouva
très bien pour ce coup, voire pour d’autres que lui donna
le fils et le père et tout, possible pour lui mieux apprendre
sa leçon, laquelle il ne lui voulut pas apprendre à demi
ni à moitié, mais à perfection. Aussi toute leçon ne vaut
rieu autrement.</p>

<p>I have heard many enterprising and successful Lovelaces
declare how that they have often seen ladies in
these faints and swoonings, yet always readily coming
to again afterward. Many women, they said, do cry
out: “Alackaday! I am a-dying!”—but ’tis, I ween, a
mighty agreeable sort of death. Others there be which
do turn back their eyes in their head for excess of pleasure,
as if about to expire outright, and let themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
go absolutely motionless and insensible. Others I have
been told do so stiffen and spasmodically contract their
nerves, arteries and limbs, as that they do bring on cramp;
as one lady I have heard speak of, which was so subject
thereto she could never be cured.</p>

<p>Anent these same swoonings, I have heard tell of a
fair lady, which was being embraced by her lover on top
of a large chest or coffer. Very suddenly and unavoidably
for herself, she did swoon right off in such wise that she
did let herself slide behind the coffer with legs projected
in the air, and getting so entangled betwixt the coffer
and the tapestry of the wall, that while she was yet
struggling to free herself and her cavalier helping her,
there entered some company and so surprised her in this
forked-radish attitude. These had time enough to see all
she had,—which was all very pretty and dainty however,—and
all the poor woman could do was to cover herself
up as best she might, saying so and so had pushed her, as
they were playing, behind the coffer, and declaring how
that she would never like the fellow again for it.</p>

<p>Cette dame courut bien plus grande fortune qu’une que
j’ai ouï dire, laquelle, alors que son ami la tenait embrassée
et investie sur le bord de son lit, quand ce vint
sur la douce fin qu’il eut achevé et que par trop il
s’étendait, il avait par cas des escarpins neufs qui avaient
la semelle glissante, et s’appuyant sur des carreaux
plombés dont la chambre était pavée, qui sont fort sujets
à faire glisser, il vint à se couler et glisser si bien sans se
pouvoir arrêter que, du pourpoint qu’il avait, tout recouvert
de clinquant, il en écorcha de telle façon le ventre, la
motte le cas et les cuisses de sa maitresse que vous eussiez
dit que les griffes d’un chat y avaient passé; ce qui cuisait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
si fort la dame qu’elle en fit un grand cri et ne s’en put
garder; mais le meilleur fut que la dame, parce que c’était
en été et faisait grand chaud, s’était mise en appareil un
peu plus lubrique que les autres fois, car elle n’avait que
sa chemise bien blanche et un manteau de satin blanc
dessus, et les caleçons à part e si bien que le gentilhomme.</p>

<p>The lady told the story to one of her female friends,
and the gentleman to one of his comrades. So the thing
came to be known, from being again repeated over to
others; for indeed ’twas a right good tale and very meet
to provoke mirth.</p>

<p>And no doubt but the ladies, whenas they be alone,
among their most privy bosom-friends, do repeat merry
tales, everywhit as much as we men-folk do, and tell each
other their amorous adventures and all their most secret
tricks and turns, and afterward laugh long and loud
over the same, making fine fun of their gallants, whenever
these be guilty of some silly mistake or commit some
ridiculous and foolish action.</p>

<p>Yea! and they do even better than this. For they do
filch their lovers the one from the other, and this sometimes
not so much for passion’s sake, but rather for to
draw from them all their secrets, the pretty games and
naughty follies they have practised with them. These
they do then turn to their own advantage, whether still
further to stir their ardour, or by way of revenge, or to
get the better one of the other in their privy debates
and wranglings when they be met together.</p>

<p>In the days of this same King Henri III. was made that
satire without words consisting of the book of pictures
I have spoke of above, of sundry ladies in divers postures
and connections with their gallants. ’Twas exceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
base and scurrilous,—for the which see the above passage
wherein I have described the same.</p>

<p>Well! enough said on this matter. I could wish from
my heart that not a few evil tongues in this our land of
France could be chastened and refrain them from their
scandal-making, and comport them more after the Spanish
fashion. For no man there durst, on peril of his
life, to make so much as the smallest reflection on the
honour of ladies of rank and reputation. Nay! so
scrupulously are they respected that on meeting them in
any place whatsoever, an if the faintest cry is raised of
<i>lugar a las damas</i>, every man doth lout low and pay them
all honour and reverence. Before them is all insolence
straitly forbid on pain of death.</p>

<p>Whenas the
<span class="no-wrap">Empress,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></span>
wife of the Emperor Charles,
made his entry into Toledo, I have heard tell how that
the Marquis de Villena, one of the great Lords of Spain,
for having threatened an alguasil, which had forcibly
hindered him from stepping forward, came nigh being
sore punished, because the threat was uttered in presence
of the Empress; whereas, had it been merely in the
Emperor’s, no such great ado would have been made.</p>

<p>The Duc de Feria being in Flanders, and the Queens
Eleanor and Marie taking the air abroad, and their
Court ladies following after them, it fell out that as he
was walking beside them, he did come to words with an
other Spanish knight. For this the pair of them came
very nigh to losing their lives,—more for having made
such a scandal before the Queen and Empress than for
any other cause.</p>

<p>The same befell Don Carlos d’Avalos at Madrid, as
Queen Isabelle of France was walking through the town;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
and had he not sped instantly into a Church which doth
there serve as sanctuary for poor unfortunate folk, he
had been straightway put to death. The end was he had
to fly in disguise, and leave Spain altogether; and was
kept in banishment all his life long and confined in the
most wretched islet of all Italy, Lipari to wit.</p>

<p>Court jesters even, which have usually full license of
free speech, an if they do assail the ladies, do get somewhat
to remember. It did so fall out one time to a Fool
called Legat, whom I once knew myself. Queen Elizabeth of
<span class="no-wrap">France<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83*]</a></span>
once in conversation speaking of the houses
at Madrid and Valladolid, how charming and agreeable
these were, did declare she wished with all her heart the
two places were so near she could e’en touch one with one
foot and the other with the other, spreading her legs very
wide open as she said the words. The Fool, who heard
the remark, cried, “And I should dearly wish to be in
betwixt, <i>con un carrajo de borrico, para encarguar y
plantar la raya</i>,”—that is, “with a fool’s cudgel to mark
and fix the boundary withal.” For this he was soundly
whipped in the kitchens. Yet was he well justified in
forming such a wish; for truly was she one of the fairest,
most agreeable and honourable ladies was ever in all
Spain, and well deserving to be desired in this fashion,—only
of folk more honourable than he an hundred thousand
times.</p>

<p>I ween these fine slanderers and traducers of ladies
would dearly love to have and enjoy the same privilege
and license the vintagers do possess in the country parts
of Naples at vintage time. These be allowed, so long as
the vintage dureth, to shout forth any sort of vile word
and insult and ribaldry to all that pass that way, coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
and going on the roads. Thus will you see them crying
and screaming after all wayfarers and vilifying the same,
without sparing any, whether great, middling or humble
folk, of what estate soever they be. Nor do they spare,—and
this is the merry part on’t,—the ladies one whit
neither, high-born dames or Princesses or any. Indeed
in my day I did there hear of not a few fine ladies, and
see them too, which would make a pretext to hie them to
the fields on purpose, so as they might pass along the
roads, and so hearken to this pretty talk and hear a thousand
naughty conceits and lusty words. These the peasants
would invent and roll off in plenty, casting up at
the great ladies their naughtiness and the shameful ways
they did use toward their husbands and lovers, going so
far as to chide them for their shameful loves and intimacies
with their own coachmen, pages, lackeys and apparitors,
which were of their train. Going yet further,
they would ask them right out for the courtesy of their
company, saying they would assault them roundly and
satisfy them better than all the others could. All this
they would let out in words of a fine, natural frankness
and bluntness, without any sort of glossing or disguising.
The ladies had their good laugh and pastime out
of the thing, and there an end, making their servants
which were with them answer back in the like strain and
give as good as they got. The vintage once done and
over, there is truce of suchlike language till another year,
else would they be brought to book and sore punished.</p>

<p>I am told the said custom doth still endure, and that
many folk in France would fain have it observed there
also at some season of the year or other, to enjoy in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
security the pleasure of their evil speaking, which they
do love so well.</p>

<p>Well! to make an end of the subject, ’tis very meet all
ladies be respected of all men, and the secret of their
loves and favours duly kept. This is why Pietro Aretino
said, that when lovers were come to it, the kisses that
man and maid did give each other were not so much for
their mutual delight as for to join connection of the
mouths together and so make signal betwixt them that
they do keep hid the secret of their merry doings. Nay,
more! that some lustful and lascivious husbands do in
their wantonness show them so free and extravagant in
words, as that not content with committing sundry
naughty profligacies with their wives, they do declare
and publish the same to their boon-companions, and
make fine tales out of them. So much so that I have
myself known wives which did conceive a mortal repugnance
to their husbands for this cause and would even
very often refuse them the pleasures they had erst afforded
them. They would not have such scandalous
things said of them, albeit ’twas but betwixt husband
and wife.</p>

<p>M. du Bellay, the poet, in his book of Latin epitaphs
called <i>Les Tombeaux</i>, which he hath composed, and very
fine it is, hath writ one on a dog, that methinks is well
worth quoting here, for ’tis writ much in our own manner.
It runneth thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">Latratu fures excepi, mutus amentes.</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Sic placui domino, sic placui dominæ.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(By my barking I did drive away thieves, with a quiet
tongue I did greet lovers. Thus I did please my master, and
thus my mistress.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>
</div>

<p>Well! if we are so to love animals for discreetness, how
much more must we not value men for holding silence?
And if we are to take advice on this matter of a courtesan
which was one of the most celebrated of former days, and
a past mistress in her art, to wit Lamia, here it is.
Asked wherein a woman did find most satisfaction in her
lover, she replied ’twas when he was discreet in talk and
secret as to what he did. Above all else she said she
did hate a boaster, one that was forever boasting of
what he did not do, yet failing to accomplish what he
promised,—two faults, each as bad as the other. She
was used to say further: that a woman, albeit ready
enough to be indiscreet, would never willingly be called
harlot, nor published abroad for such. Moreover she said
how that she did never make merry at a man’s expense,
nor any man at hers, nor did any ever miscall her. A
fair dame of this sort, so experienced in love’s mysteries,
may well give lessons to other women.</p>

<p>Well, well! enough said on these points. Another man,
more eloquent than I, might have embellished and ennobled
the subject better far. To such I do pass on
hereby mine arms and pen.</p>

Concerning married women, widows and maids,—to wit,

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> day when I was at the Court of Spain at
Madrid, and conversing with a very honourable
lady, as is the way at Kings’ Courts, she
did chance to ask me this question following:
<i>Qual era mayor fuego d’amor, el de la biuda, el de la
casada, o de la hija moça</i>,—“which of the three had the
greater heat of love, widow, wife or maid?” After myself
had told her mine opinion, she did in turn give me hers in
some such terms as these: <i>Lo que me parece d’ esta cosa es
que, aunque las moças con el hervor de la sangre, se disponen
á querer mucho, no deve ser tanto como lo que
quieren las casadas y biudas, con la gran experiencia del
negocio. Esta razon debe ser natural, como lo seria la
del que, por haver nacido ciego de la perfeccion de la luz,
no puede cobdiciar de ella con tanto deseo como el que vio,
y fue privado de la vista.</i>—“What I think on the matter
is this: that albeit maids, with all that heat of blood that
is theirs, be right well disposed to love, yet do they not
love so well as wives and widows. This is because of the
great experience of the business the latter have, and the
obvious fact that supposing a man born blind, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
birth robbed of all power of vision, he can never desire
the gift so strongly as he that hath sweetly enjoyed the
same a while and then been deprived thereof.” To which
she did presently add this further remark: <i>Con menos
pena se abstiene d’ una cosa la persona que nunca supo,
que aquella que vive enamorada del gusto pasado</i>—“How
that one could with a lesser ado refrain from a thing
one had never tried, than from one already known and
loved.” Such were the reasons this lady did adduce on
this moot point.</p>

<p>Again the respected and learned Boccaccio, among the
questions discussed in his
<span class="no-wrap"><i>Filicopo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85*]</a></span>
doth in the ninth treat
of this same problem: Which of these three, wife, widow
or maid, a man should rather fall in love with, in order
the more happily to carry his desire into effect? The
author doth answer by the mouth of the Queen he doth
there introduce speaking, that although ’tis of course
very ill done and against God and one’s own conscience
to covet a married woman, which is in no sense another’s,
but subject to her husband, it is natheless far easier to
come to the point with her than ever with maid or widow,
albeit such love is dangerous,—seeing the more a man
doth blow the fire, the more he rouseth it, whereas otherwise
it dieth down. Indeed all things do wane in the
using, except only wantonness, which doth rather wax.
But the widow, which hath been long without such exercise,
doth scarce feel it at all, and doth take no more
account of love than if she had never been married, and
is more heated by memory of the past than by present
concupiscence. Also the maid, which hath no knowledge
nor experience of what it is, save by imagination, hath
but a lukewarm longing therefor. On the other hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
the married woman, heated more than the others, doth oft
desire to come to the point and enjoy this pleasure, in
spite of its sometimes bringing on her her husband’s sore
displeasure manifested in words and eke blows. For all
this, fain to be revenged on him (for naught is so vengeful
as a woman), as well as for sake of the thing itself,
doth the wife make him cuckold right out, and enjoy the
desire of her heart. Beside, folk do soon weary of eating
ever of the same meat, and for this cause even great
Lords and Ladies do often leave good and delicate viands
for to take others instead. Moreover, with girls, ’tis a
matter of overmuch pains and consumption of time to
tame them and bring them round to the will of men; nay!
an if they <i>do</i> love, they know not that they do. But
with widows, the old fire doth readily recover its vigour,
very soon making them desire once more what by reason
of long discontinuance they had forgot the savour of.
Thus they be not slow to come back again to the old
delights, only regretting the time wasted and the weary
nights of widowhood passed all alone and uncomforted
in their cold beds.</p>

<p>In answer to these arguments of the Queen, a certain
gentleman named Faramond doth make reply. Leaving
married women aside altogether, as being so easy to get
the better of without a man’s using any great reasoning
to persuade them to it, he doth consider the case of maids
and widows, maintaining the maid to be more steadfast
in love than the widow. For the widow, who hath experienced
in the past the secrets of passion, doth never
love steadfastly, but always doubtfully and tentatively,
quickly changing and desiring now one, now another gallant,
never knowing to which she should give herself for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
her greater advantage and honour! Nay! sometimes so
vacillating is she in her long deliberations she doth choose
never an one at all, and her amorous passion can find no
steadfast hold whatever. Quite opposite is the maid, he
saith, and all such doubts and hesitations be foreign to
her. Her one desire is to have a lover true, and after
once choosing him well, to give all her soul to him and
please him in all things, deeming it the best honour she
can do him to be true and steadfast in her love. So being
only too ardent for the things which have never yet been
seen, heard or proven of her, she doth long far more than
other women which have had experience of life, to see,
hear and prove all such matters. Thus the keen desire
she hath to see new things doth strongly dominate her
heart; she doth make enquiries of them that know,—which
doth increase her flame yet more. Accordingly she
is very eager to be joined with him she hath made Lord
of her affections, whereas this same ardour is not in the
widow, seeing she hath passed that way already.</p>

<p>Well at the last the Queen in Boccaccio, taking up the
word again and wishing to give a final answer to the question,
doth thus conclude: That the widow is more painstaking
of the pleasure of love an hundred fold than the
virgin, seeing the latter is all for dearly guarding her
precious virginity and maidenhead. Further, virgins be
naturally timid, and above all in this matter, awkward
and inept to find the sweet artifices and pretty complaisances
required under divers circumstances in such
encounters. But this is not so with the widow, who is
already well practised, bold and ready in this art, having
long ago bestowed and given away what the virgin doth
make so much ado about giving. For this cause she hath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
no fear of her person being looked at, or her virtue impugned
by the discovery of any mark of lapse from honour;
and in all respects she doth better know the secret
ways for to arrive at her end. Beside all this, the maid
doth dread this first assault of her virginity, which in
many women is sometimes rather grievous and painful
than soft and pleasant, whereas widows have no such
fear, but do submit themselves very sweetly and gently,
even when the assailant be of the roughest. Now this
particular pleasure is quite different from many others,
for with them a man is oft satisfied with the first experience
and goeth lightly to others, whereas in this the longing
to return once more to the same doth ever wax more
and more. Accordingly the widow, which doth give least,
but giveth it often, is an hundred times more liberal than
the maid, when this last doth at length consent to abandon
her most precious possession, to the which she doth direct
a thousand thoughts and regrets. Wherefore, the Queen
doth conclude, ’tis much better for a man to address himself
to a widow than to a maid, as being far easier to
gain over and corrupt.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_n_coloured.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Now</span> to take and further consider these arguments
of Boccaccio, and expand them somewhat,
and discuss the same, according to the
words I have heard spoke of many honourable
gentlefolk, both men and women, on these matters,—as
the result of ample knowledge and experience, I declare
there can be no doubt that any man wishing quickly to
have fruition of love, must address him to married ladies,
an if he would avoid great trouble and much consumption
of time; for, as Boccaccio saith, the more a fire is
stirred, the more ardent doth it grow. And ’tis the married
woman which doth grow so hot with her husband,
that an if he be lacking in the wherewithal to extinguish
the fire he doth give his wife, she must needs borrow of
another man, or burn up alive. I did once know myself
a lady of good birth, of a great and high family, which
did one day tell her lover, and he did repeat the tale to
me, how that of her natural disposition she was in no
wise keen for this pleasure so much as folk would think
(and God wot this is keen enough), and was ready and
willing many a time to go without, were it not that her
husband stirring her up, while yet he was not strong
or capable enough to properly assuage her heat, he did
make her so fierce and hot she was bound to resort for
succour in this pass to her lover. Nay! very often not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
getting satisfaction enough of him even, she would withdraw
her alone, to her closet or her bed, and there in
secrecy would cure her passion as best she might. Why!
she declared, had it not been for very shame, she would
have given herself to the first she met in a ballroom,
in any alcove, or on the very steps, so tormented
was she with this terrible feeling. Herein was she for
all the world like the mares on the borders of Andalusia,
which getting so hot and not finding their stallions there
to leap them and so unable to have satisfaction, do set
their natural opening against the wind blowing in these
plains, which doth so enter in and assuageth their heat
and getteth them with foal. Hence spring those steeds
of such fleetness we see from those regions, as though
keeping some of the fleetness and natural swiftness of the
wind their sire. I ween there be husbands enough would
be right glad if their wives could find such a wind as this,
to refresh them and assuage their heat, without their
having to resort to their lovers and give their poor mates
most unbecoming horns for their heads.</p>

<p>Truly a strange idiosyncrasy in a woman, the one I
have just adduced,—not to burn, but when stirred of another.
Yet need we be in no way astonished thereat, for
as said a Spanish lady: <i>Que quanto mas me quiero sacar
de la braza, tanto mas mi marido me abraza en el brazero</i>,—“The
more I am for avoiding the embers, the more
my husband doth burn me in my brazier.” And truly
women may well be kindled that way, seeing how by mere
words, by touching and embracing alone, even by alluring
looks, they do readily allow themselves to be drawn to it,
when they find opportunity, without a thought of the
consideration they owe their husbands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span></p>

<p>For, to tell the real truth, what doth most hinder every
woman, wife or maid, from taking of this pleasure again
and again is the dread they feel of having their belly
swell, without eating beans,—an event married ladies do
not fear a whit. For an if they do so swell, why! ’tis the
poor husband that hath done it all, and getteth all the
credit. And as for the laws of honour which do forbid
them so to do, why! Boccaccio doth plainly say the most
part of women do laugh at these, alleging for reason and
justification: that Nature’s laws come first, which doth
never aught in vain, and hath given them such excellent
members to be used and set to work, and not to
be left idle and unemployed. Nature neither forbiddeth
the proper exercise of these nor imposeth disuse on
these parts more than on any other; else would the spiders
be building their webs there, as I have said in another
place, unless they do find brushes meet to sweep them away
withal. Beside, from keeping themselves unexercised do
very oft spring sore complaints and even dangers to life,—and
above all a choking of the womb, whereof so many
women die as ’tis pitiful to see, and these right fair and
honourable dames. All this for sake of this plaguey continence,
whereof the best remedy, say the doctors, is just
carnal connection, and especially with very vigorous and
well provided husbands. They say further, at any rate
some of our fair ones do, that this law of honour is only
for them that love not and have got them no true and
honourable lovers, in whom no doubt ’tis unbecoming and
blameworthy to go sacrifice to the chastity of their body,
as if they were no better than courtesans. But such as
truly love, and have gotten them lovers well chosen and
good, this law of honour doth in no wise forbid them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
help these to assuage the fires that burn them, and give
them wherewithal to extinguish the same. This is verily
and indeed for women to give life to the suppliant asking
it, showing themselves gentle-hearted benefactresses, not
savage and cruel tyrants.</p>

<p>This is what Renaldo said, whom I have spoke of in
a former discourse, when telling of the poor afflicted
Ginevra. As to this, I did once know a very honourable
lady and a great one, whom her lover did one day find in
her closet, translating that famous stanza of the said
Renaldo beginning, <i>Una donna deve dunque morire</i>,—“A
lady fair was like to die,” into French verse, as fair and
fairly wrought, as ever I have seen,—for I did see the
lines after. On his asking her what she had writ there,
she replied: “See, a translation I have just made, which
is at once mine own judgment by me delivered, and a sentence
pronounced in your favour for to content you in
that you desire,—and only the execution doth now remain;”
and this last, the reading done, was promptly carried
out. A better sentence i’faith than was ever given
in the Bailey Court of the Paris
<span class="no-wrap">Parliament!<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span>
For of
all the fine words and excellent arguments wherewith
Ariosto hath adorned Renaldo’s speech, I do assure you
the lady forgat never an one to translate and reproduce
them all well and thoroughly, so as the translation was
as meet as ever the original to stir the heart. Thus did
she let her lover plainly understand she was ready enough
to save his life, and not inexorable to his supplication,
while he was no less apt to seize his opportunity.</p>

<p>Why then shall a lady, when that Nature hath made
her good and full of pity, not use freely the gifts given
her, without ingratitude to the giver, and without resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
and contradiction to her laws? This was the view
of a fair lady I have heard speak of, which watching her
husband one day walking up and down in a great hall,
cannot refrain her from turning to her lover and saying,
“Just look at our good man pacing there; has not he
the true build of a cuckold? Surely I should have gone
sore against dame Nature, seeing she had created him
and destined him for this, an if I had contradicted her
intent and given her the lie!”</p>

<p>I have heard speak of another lady, which did thus
complain of her husband, which did treat her ill and was
ever jealously spying on her, suspecting she was making
him a set of horns: “Nay! he is too good,” she would cry
to her lover; “he thinks his fire is a match for mine.
Why! I do put his out in a turn of the hand, with four
or five drops of water. But for mine, which hath a very
different depth of furnace, I do need a flood. For we
women be of our nature like dropsical folk or a sandy
ditch, which the more water they swallow, the more they
want.”</p>

<p>Another said yet better, how that a woman was like
chickens, which do get the pip and die thereof, if they
be stinted of water and have not enough to drink. A
woman is the same, which doth breed the pip and oft die
thereof, if they are not frequently given to drink; only
’tis something else than spring water it must have. Another
fair lady was used to say she was like a good garden,
which not content with the rain of heaven only, doth ask
water of the gardener as well, to be made more fruitful
thereby. Another would say she would fain resemble
those good economists and excellent managers which do
never give out all their property to be guided and a profit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
earned to one agent alone, but do divide it among several
hands. One alone could not properly suffice to get good
value. After a similar fashion was she for managing
herself, to make the best thereof and for herself to reap
the highest enjoyment.</p>

<p>I have heard of yet another lady which had a most ill-favoured
lover, and a very handsome husband and of a
good grace, the lady herself being likewise very well-looking.
One of her chiefest lady friends and gossips
remonstrating with her and asking why she did not choose
a handsomer lover, “Know you not,” she said, “that to
cultivate well a piece of land more than one labourer is
wanted, and as a rule the best-looking and most dainty
be not the most meet workers, but the most rustical and
hardy?” Another lady I knew, which had a very ill-favoured
husband and of a very evil grace, did choose a
lover as foul as he; and when one of her friends did ask
her the reason why, “’Tis the better,” quoth she, “to
accustom me to mine husband’s ugliness.”</p>

<p>Yet another lady, discoursing one day of love, as well
her own as that of other fair ladies her companions, said:
“An if women were alway chaste, why! they would never
know but one side of life,”—herein basing on the doctrine
of the Emperor Heliogabalus, who was used to declare,
“that one half of a man’s life should be employed in virtues,
and the other half in vices; else being always in one
condition, either wholly good or wholly bad, one could
never judge of the opposite side at all, which yet doth
oft serve the better to attemper the first.” I have known
great personages to approve this maxim, and especially
where women were concerned. Again the wife of the
Emperor Sigismund, who was called
<span class="no-wrap">Barba,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87*]</a></span>
was used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
say that to be forever in one and the same condition of
chastity was a fool woman’s part, and did much reprove
her ladies, wives or maids, which did persist in this foolish
opinion, and most surely for her own part did very
thoroughly repudiate the same. For indeed all her pleasure
lay but in feasts, dances, balls and love-makings, and
much mockery was for any which did not the like, or
which did fast to mortify the flesh, and were for following
a quiet life. I leave you to imagine if it went not well
at the Court of this Emperor and Empress,—I mean for
all such, men and women, as take joy in love’s pleasures.</p>

<p>I have heard speak of a very honourable lady and of
good repute, which did fairly fall ill of the love which she
bare her lover, yet did never consent to risk the matter,
because of this same high law of honour so much insisted
on and preached up of husbands. But seeing how day
by day she was more and more consumed away and burned
up, in such wise that in a twinkling she did behold herself
wax dry, lean, and languishing, and from being aforetime
fresh, plump and in good case, now all changed and
altered, as her mirror informed her, she did at length
cry: “Nay! how shall it be said of me that in the flower
of mine age, and at the prompting of a mere frivolous
point of honour and silly scruple making me overmuch
keep in my natural fire, I did thus come to dry up and
waste away, and grow old and ugly before my time, and
lose all the bloom of my beauty, which did erst make me
valued and preferred and loved. Instead of a fair lady
of good flesh and bone I am become a skeleton, a very
anatomy, enough to make folk banish me and jeer at me
in any good company, a laughing-stock to all and sundry.
No! I will save me from such a fate; I will use the remedies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
I have in my power.” And herewith, what she said,
she did, and contenting her own and her love’s desires,
she soon gat back her flesh again and grew as fair as before,—without
her husband’s ever suspecting the remedy
she had used, but attributing the cure to the doctors,
whom he did greatly honour and warmly thank for having
so restored his wife to health for his better profit and enjoyment.</p>

<p>I have heard speak of another great lady, one of a
merry humour and a pretty wit, to whom, being sick, her
physician did one day declare how that she would never
be well, unless she changed her habits. Hereupon she
answered straight, “Well then! let us do it.” So the
physician and she did take one with the other joy of
heart and body. One day she said to him, “People all
declare you do it for me; but there, ’tis all one, as I
am so much better. And all ever I can, I will go on doing
it,—as mine health doth depend on it.”</p>

<p>These two dames last spoke of were quite unlike that
honourable lady of Pampeluna in Spain, whom I have already
mentioned in a previous passage, and who is described
in the <i>Cent Nouvelles</i> of the Queen of Navarre.
This lady, being madly in love with M. d’Avannes, did
think it better to hide her flame, and keep hid in her bosom
the passion that was consuming her, and die thereof, than
lose her honour. But by what I have heard sundry honourable
lords and ladies say in discussing the matter, she
was a fool for her pains, and little regardful of her soul’s
salvation, seeing she did bring about her own death, it
being in her power to avoid this extremity, and all for
a trifle. For in very fact, as an old French proverb doth
put it, “<i>D’une herbe de pré tondue et d’un c... f...,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
le dommage est bientôt rendu.</i>” And what is it, when
all is done? The business, once done, is like any other;
what sign is there of it to men’s eyes? Doth the lady
walk any the less upright? doth the world know aught?
I mean of course when ’tis done in secret, with closed
doors, and no man by to see. I would much like to know
this, if many of the great ladies of mine own acquaintance,
for ’tis with such love doth most take up abode (as this
same lady of Pampeluna saith, ’tis at high portals that
high winds do beat), if these do therefore cease to walk
abroad with proudly lifted head, whether at this Court
of France or elsewhere, and show them as unabashed as
ever a Bradamant or Marfisa of them all. And pray,
who would be so presumptuous as to ask them if they
condescend to it? Even their husband (I tell you), the
most of them at any rate, would never dare to charge
them with it, so well do they understand the art of concealment
and the keeping of a confident show and carriage.
But an if these same husbands, any of them, do
think to speak thereof and threaten them, or punish them
with harsh words or deeds, why! they be undone; for
then, even though before they had planned no ill against
them, yet do they straightway plot revenge and give them
back as good as they have gotten. For is there not an
old proverb which saith, “When and so soon as a husband
doth beat his wife, her body doth laugh for joy”? That
is to say, it doth presently look for good times, knowing
the natural bent of its mistress, who unable to avenge
her wrongs by other weapons, will turn it to account as
second and best ally, to pay her husband back with her
lover’s help, no matter what watch and ward the poor
man keep over her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span></p>

<p>For verily, to attain their end, the most sovran means
they have is to make their complaints to one another, or
to their women and maids of the chamber, and so win
these over to get them new lovers, if they have none, or
an if they have, to convey these privily to places of
assignation; and ’tis they which do mount guard that
neither husband nor any other surprise them at it. Thus
then do these ladies gain over their maids and women,
bribing them with presents and good promises. In certain
cases beside they do make agreement and composition
with these, on the terms that of all the lover may give their
lady mistress, the servant shall have the half or at least
the third part thereof. But the worst is, very often the
mistresses do deceive their servants, taking the whole for
themselves, making excuse that their lover hath given
them no more than so small a share as that they have not
enough to spare aught for others. Thus do they hoax
these poor wenches and serving maids, albeit they stand
sentinel and keep good watch. This is a sore injustice;
and I ween, were the case to be tried with proper arguments
pleaded on this side and that, ’twould afford occasion
for much merriment and shrewd debate. For ’tis
verily theft, no less, so to filch their benefices and emoluments
duly agreed upon. Other ladies there be however
who do keep faithfully their promise and compact, and
hold back naught, for to be the better served and loyally
helped, herein copying those honest shop-keepers, who
do render a just proportion of the gain and profit of
the talent their master or partner hath entrusted them
withal. And truly such dames do deserve to be right well
served, seeing they be duly grateful for the trouble, and
good watch and ward of their inferiors. And these last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
do run many risks and perils,—as one I wot of, who keeping
guard one day, the while her mistress was with her
lover and having merry times, both the twain being right
well occupied, was caught by the husband’s house-steward.
The man did chide her bitterly for what she was at, saying
’twere more becoming for her had she been with her
mistress than to be playing procuress like this and standing
sentinel outside her door. ’Twas a foul trick she
was playing her mistress’ husband, and he would go warn
him. However the lady did win him over by means of
another of her maids, of whom he was enamoured and
who did promise him some favour at her mistress’ prayers;
beside, she did make him a present, and he was at last appeased.
Natheless she did never like him afterward, and
kept a shrewd eye on his doings; finally spying an opportunity
and taking it on the hop, she did get him dismissed
by her husband.</p>

<p>I wot of a fair and honourable
<span class="no-wrap">lady,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88*]</a></span>
which did take a
serving maid of hers into great intimacy and high favour
and friendship, even allowing her much intimacy, having
trained her well for such intercourse. So free was she
with her mistress that sometimes when she did see this
lady’s husband longtime absent from his house, engaged
either at Court or on some journey, oft would she gaze
at her mistress as she was dressing her, (and she was one
of the most beautiful and lovable women of her day),
and presently remark: “Ah, me! is he not ill-starred,
Madam, that husband of yours, to possess so fair a wife,
and yet have to leave her thus all alone so long without
ever setting eyes on her? Doth he not deserve you should
cuckold him outright? You really ought; and if I were
as handsome as you, I should do as much to mine husband,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
if he tarried so much away.” I leave you to judge
if the lady and mistress of this serving maid did find
this a tasty nut to crack, especially finding as she did
shoes all ready to her feet, whereof she did after make
good use, freely employing so handy an instrument.</p>

<p>Again, there be ladies which do make use of their serving
maids to help them hide their amours and prevent
their husbands observing aught amiss, and do give them
charge of their lovers, to keep and hold them as their
own suitors, under this pretext to be able at any time to
say, if the husbands do find them in their wives’ chambers,
that they be there as paying court to such or such an
one of their maids. So under this cloak hath the lady a
most excellent means of playing her game, and the husband
know naught at all about it. I knew a very great
Prince indeed which did set him to pay court to a lady
of the wardrobe to a great Princess, solely to find out the
secret intrigues of her mistress, and so the better gain
success in that quarter.</p>

<p>I have seen plenty of these tricks played in my lifetime,
though not altogether in the fashion followed by a certain
honourable lady of the world I once knew, which was so
fortunate as to be loved of three brave and gallant gentlemen,
one after the other. These on quitting her, did
presently after love and serve a very great lady, whereon
she did very pleasantly and good-humouredly deliver herself
to this effect. ’Twas she, she said, who had so trained
and fashioned them by her excellent lessons, as that coming
now into the service of the said great Princess, they
were exceeding well formed and educated. To rise so high,
she declared, ’twas very needful first to serve smaller folk,
in order not to fail with greater; for to arrive at any supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
degree of skill, a man must needs mount first by
small and low degrees, as is seen in all arts and sciences.</p>

<p>This did her great honour. Yet more deserving still
was another I have heard tell of, which was in the train
of a great lady. This lady was married, and being surprised
by her husband in her chamber receiving a little
paper note or <i>billet doux</i> from her lover, was right well
succoured by her subordinate. For this last, cleverly intercepting
the note, did swallow down the same at one
gulp without making any bones about it and without the
husband perceiving aught, who would have treated his
wife very ill indeed, if he had once seen the inside. This
was a very noble piece of service, and one the great lady
was always grateful for.</p>

<p>On the other hand I wot well of ladies which have found
them in evil case for having overmuch trusted their serving
maids, and others again for not having trusted them
at all. I have heard speak of a fair and honourable lady,
who had taken and chose out a gentleman, one of the
bravest, most valiant and well accomplished of all France,
to give the same pleasure and delight of herself. She
would never trust any one of her women, and assignation
being given in a friend’s house, it was concerted and
arranged there should be but one bed in the chamber, her
women all sleeping in the antechamber. As settled, so
done. And as there was a cat’s-hole in the door, which
they had not remembered or provided for till the moment,
they bethought them to stop this with a thin board, to
the end that if any pushed it down, it would make a rattle,
which they would hear and could take measures accordingly.
One of her women, suspecting a snake in the grass,
and angry and hurt because her mistress had not confided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
in her, whom she had ever made her chiefest confidante,
and had given many proofs thereof, doth now make
up her mind, so soon as her mistress was to bed, to keep
a look out and listen at the door. She could hear quite
well a low murmuring, yet was sure ’twas not the reading
aloud her mistress had for some days indulged in in bed,
with a candle, the better to dissemble what she was going
to do. Just as she was on the tip-toe of curiosity, to
know more, an excellent occasion did present itself most
opportunely. For a kitten happening to come into the
room, she and her companions take the animal and push
it through the cat’s-hole into her mistress’ chamber, not
of course without knocking down the board that kept it
closed and making a clatter. At this the pair of lovers,
sore startled, did suddenly sit up in bed, and saw by the
light of their candle ’twas only a cat that had come in and
knocked down the board. Wherefore without troubling
more about it, they laid them down again, seeing ’twas
now late and everybody presumably asleep, but never shut
to again the cat’s-hole, leaving the same open for the cat
to go out again by, as they did not care to have it shut
up in their room all night long. Seizing so good an opportunity,
the said waiting maid and her companions had
a fine chance to see enough and to spare of their mistress’
doings. These they did after reveal to the husband,
whence came death for the lover, and shame and disgrace
for the lady.</p>

<p>This is what doth come of despite and want of confidence
shown folk, which be often just as productive of ill
consequences as over-confidence. I have heard of a very
great nobleman which was moved one time to take all his
wife’s waiting-maids (and she was a well-born and very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
fair lady), and have them tortured to make them confess
all their misdeeds and the services they had rendered her
in her amours. However his first intent was carried no
further, to avoid too horrible a scandal. The first suggestion
came from a lady whose name I will not give,
who had a grudge against the said great lady. For the
which God did punish her later.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">So</span> now, following the order of Boccaccio, our
guide in this discourse, I come next to maids.
These, it must certainly be allowed, be of
their nature exceeding timid at first beginning,
and dare in no wise yield up what they hold so
dear, spite of the constant persuasion and advice their
fathers, mothers, kinsfolk and mistresses do give them,
along with most moving threats. So it is that, though
they should have all the good will thereto in the world,
yet they do deny themselves all ever they can; beside
they have ever before their eyes the terror lest their
bodies do play them false and betray them, else would
they try many a tasty morsel. Yet all have not this
scrupulousness; for shutting their eyes to all reflection,
some do rush boldly into it,—not indeed with head down,
but rather thrown well back. Herein do they make a
sore mistake, seeing how terrible is the scandal of a maid
deflowered, and of a thousandfold more import than for
married woman or widow. For a maid, this treasure of
hers once lost, is made the object of endless scandal and
abuse, is pointed at by all men, and doth lose many a
good opportunity of marriage. For all this, I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
known not a few cases where some rough fellow or other
hath been found, either willingly, or of sudden caprice,
knowingly or unwittingly, on compulsion, to go throw
himself into the breach, and marry them, as I have described
elsewhere, all tarnished as they were, but right
glad to get them churched after all.</p>

<p>Many such of either sex have I known in my day, and
in especial one maid which did most shamefully let herself
be got with child by a great
<span class="no-wrap">Prince,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89*]</a></span>
and that without
an attempt at hiding or dissembling her condition. On
being discovered, all she said was this: “What was I to
do? ’tis not my frailty you must blame, nor my lustfulness,
but only my over heedlessness and lack of foresight.
For an if I had been as clever and knowing as the most
part of my companions, which have done just as ill as I,
or even worse, but have had wit enough to cure their
pregnancy or conceal their lying-in, I should not now
be in this strait, nor had any known a word about it.”
Her companions did for this word wish her mighty ill;
and she was accordingly expelled the band by her mistress,
albeit ’twas reported this same mistress had ordered
her to yield to the wishes of the Prince, wishing to
get an hold over him and win him to herself. For all
this, however, the girl failed not some while after to make
a good match and contract a rich marriage, and presently
give birth to a noble offspring. Thus we see, an if
the poor child had been as wily as her comrades and
other girls, this luck had never been hers. And truly in
my day I have seen mere girls as clever and expert in
these matters as ever the oldest married woman, nay!
going so far as to be most effective and experienced
procuresses, and not content with their own satisfaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
only, to be after contriving the same delights for others
to boot.</p>

<p>’Twas a lady in waiting at the French Court which did
invent and have performed that fine Comedy entitled the
<i>Paradis d’Amour</i> (Paradise of Love) in the Salle de
Bourbon with closed doors, at which performance were
none but actors and actresses present, forming players
and audience both together. Such as do know the story
will know what I mean. The play had six characters,
three male and three female. Of these one was a Prince,
who had his fair one, a great lady, though not too great
neither, yet did he love her dearly; the second was a
Lord, who did intrigue with the great Lady, a lady very
liberal of her favours; the third was a simple gentleman,
who did carry on with the maid, whom he did marry later.
For the gallant authoress was fain to see her own character
represented on the stage no less than the rest!
Indeed ’tis ever so with the author of a Comedy; he doth
put himself in the play, or else in the prologue. And so
did this one, and on my faith, girl as she was, did play
the part as well as the married women, if not better.
The fact is she had seen more of the world than just her
own country, and as the Spaniards say <i>rafinada en
Secobia</i>,—had had a Segovia polish or fining. This is a
proverb in Spain, Segovia being where the best cloths are
fined.</p>

<p>I have heard tales told of many maids, who while serving
their lady mistresses as <i>Dariolettes</i>, or confidantes,
have been fain to taste and try the same dainties. Such
ladies moreover be often slaves in their own women’s
hands, from dread of their discovering them and publishing
abroad their amours, as I have noted above. ’Twas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
a lady in waiting who did one day tell me her opinion,—that
’twas a mighty piece of folly for maids to sacrifice
their honour to their passions, and while some silly creatures
were restrained therefrom by their scruples, for
herself she would not deign to do it, the whole thing
ending in mere shame and disgrace. On the other hand
the trick of keeping one’s affair privy and secret made
all right, and girls were mere fools and unfit for this
wicked world which cannot help themselves and manage
the thing quietly.</p>

<p>A Spanish lady, thinking her daughter was afraid of
the violence of the first wedding night, went to her and
began to encourage her and persuade her ’twas naught
at all and she would feel no pain, adding that herself
would be right glad to be in her place the better to show
her how to bear it. To this the girl replied, <i>Bezo las
manos, señora madre, de tal merced, que bien la tomaré
yo por mi</i>,—“Much thanks, my lady mother, for your
kind offer, but I will manage very well by myself.”</p>

<p>I have heard a merry tale of a girl of very high birth,
who had contrived to afford herself much pleasure in her
life so far, and whom her family now spake of marrying
in Spain. One of her most special and privy friends said
one day to her, by way of jest, how surprised he was to
find that she, which had so dearly loved the <i>rising</i> quarter,
was now about to travel toward the setting or western,
because Spain lies to the westward. To this the
lady made answer, “Truly, I have heard mariners say,
men that have travelled far, how that the navigation of
the rising quarter is right pleasant and agreeable; and
indeed myself have steered many a time thither by the
compass I do alway carry on me. So I will take advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of this same instrument, when I am in the land of the
setting sun, yet to hie away me straight to the rising.”
Judicious commentators will find it easy enough to interpret
the allegory and make a shrewd guess at what
I point to. I leave you to judge by these words whether
the damsel had invariably limited her reading to the
“hours” of Our Lady, and none other.</p>

<p>Another damsel I have heard of, and could give her
name, who hearing of the wonders of the city of Venice,
its singular beauties and the liberties there enjoyed of all,
and especially of harlots and courtesans, did exclaim to
one of her bosom friends, “I would to God we had despatched
thither all our wealth by letter of credit, and
were there arrived ourselves for to lead the gay and
happy existence of its courtesans, a life none other can
come near, even though we were Empresses of all the
whole world!” Truly a good wish and an excellent! And
in very deed I opine they that be fain of such a life could
hardly dwell in a better spot.</p>

<p>No less do I admire another wish, expressed by a lady
of former days. She was questioning a poor slave escaped
from the Turks as to the tortures and sufferings
these did inflict on him and other unhappy Christian
captives, who did tell her enough and to spare of cruelties
so inflicted of every sort and kind. Presently she
did ask him what they did to women. “Alas and alas!
Madam,” said he, “they do it to them, and go on doing
it, till they die.”—“Well! I would to God,” she cried,
“I might die so, a martyr to the faith.”</p>

<p>Three great Ladies, of whom one was a maid, being
together one day, as I am told, did begin telling their
wishes. One said, “I would fain have an apple-tree that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
should bear every year as many golden apples as it doth
common fruit.” The second, “I would have a meadow
that should yield me jewels and precious stones as many
as it doth flowers.” The third, which was a maid, “And
I would choose a dovecote, whereof the openings should
be worth as much to me as such and such a lady’s coop,
such and such a great King’s favourite, whose name I will
not speak; only I should like mine to be visited of more
pigeons than is hers.”</p>

<p>These dames were of a different complexion from a
certain Spanish lady, whose life is writ in the History of
Spain, and who, one day when Alfonzo the Great, King
of Aragon, made a state entry into Saragossa, threw
herself on her knees before his Majesty to ask justice
of him. The King signifying his willingness to hear her,
she did ask to speak to him in private, and he did grant
her this favour. Hereupon she laid a complaint against
her husband, for that he would lie with her two and
thirty times a month, by day no less than a-nights, in
such wise that he gave her never a minute of rest or
respite. So the King did send for the husband and
learned of him ’twas true, the man deeming he could not
be in the wrong seeing it was his own wife; then the
King’s council being summoned to deliberate on the matter,
his Majesty did issue decree and ordered that he
should touch her but six times,—not without expressing
his much marvel at the exceeding heat and puissance
of the fellow, and the extraordinary coldness and continence
of the wife, so opposite to the natural bent of
other women (so saith the story), which be ever ready to
clasp hands and beseech their husbands or other men
to give them enough of it, and do make sore complaint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
an if these do give to others what is their share by rights.</p>

<p>Very different from this last was another lady, a young
girl of a good house, who the day after her wedding,
recounting over to her companions her adventures in the
night just done, “What!” cried she, “and is that all?
For all I had heard some of you say, and other women,
and men to boot, which do boast them so bold and gallant,
and promise such mountains of wondrous deeds, why!
o’ my faith, friends and comrades mine, the man (meaning
her husband), that made himself out so hot a lover
and valiant a wight, and so fine a runner at the ring, did
run but four all counted,—as it were the regular three
for the ring and one for the ladies.” We can but suppose,
as she made such complaint of scanty measure, she
would fain have had a round dozen to her share; but
everyone is not like the Spanish gentleman of our last
story.</p>

<p>This is how they do make mock of their husbands. So
one, who when just wed on her first marriage night, did
play the prude and was for obstinately resisting her husband.
But he did bethink him to declare that, and if he
had to take his big dagger, ’twould be another game altogether,
and she would have something to cry out for;
whereat the child, fearing the big weapon he did threaten
her withal, did yield her instantly to his wishes. But next
time, she was no longer afeared, and not content with
the little one, did ask at first go off for the big one
he had threatened her with the night before. To which
the husband replied he had never a big one, and had
said so but in jest; so she must e’en be satisfied with
what little provision he had about him. Then she cried,
“Nay! ’tis very ill done, so to make mock of poor, simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
maids!” I wot not whether we should call this damsel
simple and ignorant, and not rather knowing and artful,
as having tried the thing before. I do refer the question
to the learned for decision.</p>

<p>Bien plus estait simple une autre fille, laquelle s’estant
plaincte à la justice que un gallant l’ayant prise par
force, et lui enquis sur ce fait, il respondit: “Messieurs,
je m’en rapporte à elle s’il est orai, et si elle i’a pris mon
cas et l’a mis de sa main propre dans lie sien.—Ha! Messieurs,
(dit la fille) il est bien orai cela, mais qu’il ne l’enst
fait? Car, amprés qu’il m’ent couchée et trousée, il me
mit sou cas roide et poinctu comme un baston contre la
ventre, et m’en domisit de si grands coups que j’ens peur
qu’il me le percast et m’y fist im trou. Dame! je lui
pris ahers et le mis dans le tron qui estoit tout fait.” Si
cette fille estoit simplette, on le contrefaisoit, j m’en
<span class="no-wrap">rapporte.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90*]</a></span></p>

<p>I will now tell a couple of stories of two married
women, of as great a simplicity as the last,—or, if you
prefer it so, of as great artfulness. The first was a very
great lady of mine acquaintance, a very fine woman and
much sought after for this reason. One day a very great
Prince did make offers to her, pressing her right eagerly
and promising her very fine and most advantageous conditions,
rank and riches without end for herself and her
husband, so much so that she did hearken at first and
give a willing ear to such seductive temptations. However
she would not right off consent, but in her simplicity
as a new made wife, knowing naught of the wicked
world, she did come and reveal the whole matter to her
husband, asking his advice whether she should do it or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
no. The husband firing up instantly, cried, “Never,
never, by God! little wife; what are you talking about,
what would you be at? ’Tis a foul deed, an irreparable
stain on both of us!”—“But, Sir,” returned the lady,
“we shall both be such grand folk, no one will have a
word to say against us.” In a word the husband did
refuse absolutely; but the lady, beginning presently to
pluck up a spirit and understand the world, was loath to
lose the chance, and did take her fling with the said
Prince and others beside, quite forgetting her erstwhile
simpleness. I have heard the story told by one which
had it of the Prince in question. The lady too had confided
it to him; and he had chid her, counselling her
that in such affairs one should never consult the husband,
who was of necessity a prejudiced party.</p>

<p>Not less simple-minded, or very little, was another
young married dame I have heard of, to whom one day an
honourable gentleman did proffer his love, at the husband’s
very elbow, who for the moment was holding discourse
with another lady. The suitor did suddenly put
<i>son instrument entre les mains. Elle le prit et, le serrant
fort étroitement et se tournant vers son mari, lui dit:
“Mon mari, voyez le beau présent que me fait ce gentilhomme;
le recevraije? dites-le-moi.” Le pauvre gentilhomme,
étonné, retire à soi son épervier de si grande
rudesse que, recontrant une pointe de diamant qu’elle
avait au doigt, le lui esserta de telle façon d’un bout à
l’autre qu’elle le crut perdre du tout</i>, and suffered very
great pain and even came in danger of his life. He
rushed frantically from the room, watering all the place
with his gore which flowed in torrents. The husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
made no ado about running after him to utter any recriminations
on the matter; all he did was to burst out
a-laughing heartily, at once at the simplicity of his poor
little wife, and because the fellow was so soundly punished.</p>

<p>Well! here is a village story I must needs tell, for
’tis not a bad one. A village wench, as they were leading
her to church on her wedding-day to the sound of tabor
and flute, and with much rustic ceremony, chancing to
catch sight of her girlhood’s lover, did shout out these
words to him, “Farewell, Pierre, farewell! I’ve got....
You’ll never give it me any more. My mother’s married
me now,”—blurting the word right out. Her simplicity
was no less admirable than the soft regret she showed
for past days.</p>

<p>One more, as we are on village tales. A pretty young
girl took a load of wood to sell at the market town.
Asked how much, she kept continually raising her price
at each offer made her by the dealers. “You shall have
so much,” they cried, “and something else into the bargain.”—“’Tis
well said,” she cried, “and thank you!
you’re the very man.”</p>

<p>Right simple-minded wenches these, and very different,
they and their like, (for there be plenty such), from a
whole host of others in this wicked world, which be far
more double-dealing and knowing than these, never asking
counsel of their husbands nor never showing them such
presents as they may get.</p>

<p>I heard an anecdote once in Spain of a young girl who
the first night after her marriage, as her husband was
struggling and sweating sore and hurting himself in his
attempts, did set up a laugh and tell him, <i>Señor, bien es<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
razon que seays martyr, pues que io soy virgen; mas pues
que io tomo la paciencia, bien la podeys tomar</i>,—“Sir,
’tis but right you should be a martyr, since I am a virgin;
but as I am so patient, you must be patient too.” Thus
in revenge of his making fun of his wife, did she make
fine fun of him. And in good sooth many a girl hath
good cause to make mock at such a time, especially when
they have learned afore what it all is, or have been informed
of others, or have themselves dreamed and pictured
out this mighty moment of delight, which they do
suppose so great and lasting.</p>

<p>Another Spanish bride, telling over next morning her
husband’s merits, found several to praise, “only” she
added, “<i>que no era buen contador aritmetico, porque no
sabia multiplicar</i>,—that he was not a good arithmetician
at all, for he couldn’t multiply.”</p>

<p>Another young maid of good birth and family (one
myself have known and talked with), on her wedding
night, when all the company were listening outside the
door according to custom, and the husband had just
given her the first embrace, and as he did rest a while,
though not yet asleep, asked her if she would like some
more of the same, “An if it please you, Sir!” she said.
Imagine the gallant bridegroom’s astonishment at such an
answer, and how he must have rubbed his ears.</p>

<p>Maids which do say such tricky things so readily and
so soon after marriage, may well rouse strange suspicions
in their poor husbands’ breasts, and lead them to suppose
they be not the first that have dropped anchor in their
bay, nor will be the last so to do. For we cannot doubt,
an if a man do not strive hard and nigh kill himself to
work well his wife, she will soon bethink her of giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
him a pair of pretty horns, or as an old French proverb
put it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">Et qui ne la contente pas,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Va ailleurs chercher son repas.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Yet when a woman doth get all ever she can out of a
man, she doth knock him clean over, just doing him to
death. ’Tis an old saying: A woman should not take of a
lover all she would have, but must spare him what she
can; not so with an husband, him she should drain to
the very bones. And this is why, as the Spanish saw
hath it, <i>que el primero pensamiento de la muger, luego
que es casada, es de embiudarse</i>.—“A married woman’s
first thought is to contrive to make herself a widow.”
This saying is not universally true, as I do hope to show
in another place; it doth only apply to some women, and
not all.</p>

<p>Some girls there be which, when no longer able to
restrain themselves, be ready to give themselves only to
Princes and great Lords, folk very meet to stir their
passion, both by reason of their gracious condescension
and the fine presents they make, as well as for love of
their good looks and pretty ways, for indeed all is fine
and point-device, though they may be silly coxcombs and
no more, as myself have seen some. Other girls again do
not seek after such at all, but do rather avoid them all
they can, because they have something of a repute for
being scandal-mongers, great boasters, indiscreet and
garrulous. They do prefer instead simple gentlemen of
prudent and discreet complexion, but alas! the number
of such is very small. Happy she who doth meet with
such an one! To avoid all these inconveniences, girls do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
choose, (at least some do) their men-servants, some being
handsome men, some not,—and I have myself known
ladies which have acted so. Nor doth it take much urgency
to persuade the fellows; for putting them to bed
and getting them up as they do, undressing them, putting
their foot-gear on and off, and even changing their shifts,—and
I have seen many young girls at Court and elsewhere
which did make no sort of difficulty or scruple
about all this,—seeing so many pretty sights as they
must, they cannot but feel temptation. And I ween some
of their mistresses do of set purpose let them see their
charms freely. The end can only be that, when the eyes
have done their office, other senses be presently called
in to execute theirs.</p>

<p>I knew once a fair damsel of the great world, a beauty
if ever there was one, which did make her man-servant
share her with a great Prince, who kept her as his mistress
and supposed he was the only happy possessor of
her favours. But herein the valet marched step by step
with him; and indeed she had made no ill choice, so
handsome a man was he and of so fine a figure; indeed,
no difference was to be noted. In fact the valet did have
the advantage of the Prince in many beauties of person;
and the latter knew never a word about the intimacy
till he finally quitted the lady on his marriage. Nor did
he for this treat the man any the worse, but was always
glad to see him; and whenever he caught sight of him in
passing, he would merely cry, “Is it possible now this
fellow was my rival? Well, well! I can quite believe it,
for barring my rank, he hath the better of me otherwise.”
He bore the same name as the Prince, and was a most
excellent tailor, one of the most famous at Court. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
was hardly a woman there, single or married, but he did
dress them, when they were for exquisite costumes. I
cannot tell whether he was used to dress them in the same
fashion he dressed his mistress, but they were invariably
well put on.</p>

<p>I knew once a young girl of a good house, which had a
boy lackey of only fourteen, whom she had made her
fool and plaything. Amid their plays and foolings, she
did make no kind of difficulty whatever to let him kiss
her, as privily as it had been only a woman,—and this
very often before company, excusing it all by saying he
was her pretty fool and little playmate. I wot not
whether he went further, but I do know that afterward,
as wife and widow, and wife once more, she was ever a
most notable whore. Remember how she did kindle her
match at this first fire, so that she did never after lack
flame in any of her later and greater passions and escapades.
I had tarried a good year before I saw this
lady; but when I did behold her at home and with her
mother, who had the repute of being one of the most
accomplished of sham prudes of her day, laughing and
making light of the whole thing, I did foresee in a moment
how this little game would lead to a more serious
one, and one played in downright earnest, and that the
damsel would one day grow a very glutton at it, as was
afterward the case.</p>

<p>I knew two sisters of a very good old family in Poitou,
and both unmarried, of whom strange tales were told,
and particularly with regard to a tall Basque footman
of their father’s. This fellow, under pretext of his fine
dancing, (for he could dance not only his native <i>brawls</i>,
but all the other dances as well), would commonly take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
them out to dance and teach them the steps and be partner
to them. Later he did teach them the harlot’s reel,
and they gat themselves finely talked about. Still they
found no difficulty in getting husbands, for they were
very wealthy folk; and this word wealth covereth up all
defects, so as men will pick up anything, no matter how
hot and scalding. I knew the said Basque afterward as a
good soldier and brave man, and one that showed he had
had some training. He was dismissed his place, to avoid
scandal, and became a soldier in the Guard in M. d’Estrozze’s
regiment.</p>

<p>I knew likewise another great house, and a noble, the
lady mistress whereof did devote herself to bringing up
young maids of birth in her household, amongst others
sundry kinswomen of her husband’s. Now the lady being
very sickly and a slave to doctors and apothecaries, there
was always plenty of these to be found thereabouts.
Moreover young girls be subject to frequent sicknesses,
such as pallors, anæmia, fevers and the like, and it so
happened two of them fell ill of a quartan ague, and
were put under the charge of an apothecary to cure them.
And he did dose them well with his usual drugs and medicines;
but the best of all his remedies was this, that he
did sleep with one of them,—the presumptuous villain, for
he had to do with as fair and honourable a maid as any
in France, and one a great King had been well content
to enjoy; yet must Master Apothecary have his will of
her.</p>

<p>Myself knew the damsel, who did certainly deserve a
better lover. She was married later, and given out for
virgin,—and virgin she was found to be. Herein did she
show her cunning to some purpose; for <i>car, puisqu’elle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
ne pouvait tenir son eau, elle s’adressa à celui qui donnait
les antidotes pour engarder d’engrosser, car c’est ce que
les filles craignent le plus: dont en cela il y en a de si
experts qui leur donnent des drogues qui les engardent
très bien d’engrosser; ou bien, si elles engrossent, leur font
écouler leur grossesse so subtilement et si sagement que
jamais on ne s’en aperçoit, et n’en sent-on rien que le vent</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ainsi que j’en ai ouï parler d’une fille, laquelle avait
été autrefois nourrie fille de la feue reine de Navarre
Marguerite. Elle vint par cas fortunt, ou à engrosser
sans qu’elle y pensât pourtant. Elle rencontra un rusé
apothicaire, qui, lui ayant donné un breuvage, lui fit
évader son fruit, qui avait déjà six mois, pièce par pièce,
morceau par morceau, si aisément, qu’étant en ses affaires
jamais elle n’en sentit ni mal ni douleur; et puis après
se maria galamment, sans que le mari y connut aucune
trace; car on leur donne des remèdes pour se faire paraître
vierges et pucelles comme auparavant, ainsi que
j’en ai allégué un au</i> <span class="smcap">Discoups des Cocus</span>. <i>Et un que
j’en ouï dire à un empirique ces jours passés, qu’il faut
avoir des sangsues et les mettre à la nature, et faire par
là tirer et sucer le sang: lesquelles sangsues, en suçant,
laisent et engendrent de petites ampoules et fistules
pleines de sang; si bien que le galant mari, qui vient le
soir des noces les assaillir, leur crève ces ampoules d’où
le sang sort, et lui et elle s’ensanglantent, qui est une
grande joie à l’un et à l’autre; et par ainsi,</i> l’honor della
citella è salva. <i>Je trouve ce remède plus souverain que
l’autre, s’il est vrai; et s’ils ne sont bons tous deux, il
y en a cent autres qui sont meilleurs, ainsi que le savent
très bien ordonner, inventer et appliquer ces messieurs les
médecins savants et experts apothicaires. Violà pourquoi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
ces messieurs ont ordinairement de très belles et
bonnes fortunes, car ils savent blesser et remédier, ainsi
qui fit la lance de Pélias.</i></p>

<p>Myself knew the Apothecary I spake of but now, as to
whom I will add only one word more in passing,—how
I saw him at Geneva the first time I did visit Italy, for
at that time the common road for French travellers
thither was by Switzerland and the Grisons, because of
the wars then raging. He came to see me at my lodging.
Of a sudden I did ask him what he was doing in that
town, and whether he was there to medicine pretty girls,
the same as he had done in France. He answered me
he was there to repent of such misdoings. “What!” said
I, “you have not such dainty bits to taste here as you
had there?”—“Ah! Sir,” he replied, “’tis because God
hath called me, and I am enlightened of his spirit, and
I have now knowledge of his Holy Word.”—“Yes! yes!”
I went on, “in those days too you were a pious Protestant,
and did combine medicine for the body and for the soul,
preaching to the girls and giving them some fine instruction.”—“But,
my dear Sir, I do know my God better
these days,” he returned again, “than then, and would
fain sin no more.” I need not repeat much other discourse
we had on this subject, both seriously and in jest;
but the impudent scamp did certainly enjoy that pretty
bit of flesh, more meet for some gallant gentleman than
for such as he. It was as well for him he did quit that
house pretty smartly; else had he fared ill. However,
enough of this. Cursed be the fellow, for the hate and
envy I do bear him,—as did M. de Ronsard to a physician
which was used to come night and morning rather to see
the poet’s mistress, and feel her breasts and bosom and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
rounded arm, than to medicine her for the fever she had.
He writ a very charming sonnet on the subject; ’tis in
the second book of his <i>Amours</i>, and begins thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">Hé que je porte et de hayne et d’envie</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Au médecin qui vient et matin,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Sans nul propos, tastonner le tétin,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Le sein, le ventre et les flancs de ma mye.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I do bear a like fierce jealousy against a physician
which did similarly toward a fair and noble lady I was
enamoured
<span class="no-wrap">of,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91*]</a></span>
and from whom I never gat any such
privileges and familiarities, though I had loved them
better than the winning of a little kingdom. These gentry
are for sure exceeding agreeable to dames and damsels,
and do have fine adventures with them, an if they seek
after such. I have known two physicians at Court, one
M. Castellan, physician to the Queen Mother, the other
the Seigneur Cabrian, physician to M. de Nevers, and
who had held the same office with Ferdinand de Gonzague.
Both have enjoyed successes with women, by all
one hears, that the greatest noblemen at Court would
have sold their souls to the devil for to have gone shares
with them.</p>

<p>We were discoursing one day, the late Baron de Vitaux
and myself, with M. Le Grand, a famous physician of
Paris, a man of agreeable manners and excellent counsel,
he having come to visit the said Baron, who was ill of some
amorous indiscretion. Both of us questioning him on
sundry little ways and peculiarities of the ladies, he did
entertain us finely, and told us a round dozen of tales
that did verily take the prize. So engrossed did he grow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
herewith, that, nine o’clock striking, he cried, getting up
from the chair where he was seated: “Truly, I am a greater
simpleton than you two, which have kept me here two
good hours chattering with you rascals, and all the while
I have been forgetting six or seven sick folk I am bound
to go visit.” So with a word of farewell, he doth hie him
away, though not without a further last word in reply
to us, when we called after him: “Rascal yourself, Doctor!
Oh! you doctors know some fine things and do ’em
too, and you especially, for you talk like a past master
of the art.” He answered us, looking down, “True
enough, true enough! we both know and do some fine
doings, for we do possess sundry secrets not open to all
the world. But I’m an old man now, and have bid a long
farewell to Venus and her boy. Nowadays I leave all this
to you younger rascals.”</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">2.</p>

<p>We read in the life of St. Louis, in the History of
Paulus Aemilius, of a certain Marguerite,
Countess of Flanders, sister of Jeanne, daughter
of Baldwin I., Emperor of the Greeks, and
his successor, seeing she had no children,—so says History.
She was given in her early girlhood a teacher named Guillaume,
a man esteemed of an holy life and who had already
taken minor orders. Yet did this in no wise hinder him to
get two children of his fair pupil, which were christened
Baldwin and John, and all so privily as that few folk knew
aught of the matter. The two boys were later declared
legitimate by the Pope. What fine teaching, and what a
teacher! So much for History.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span></p>

<p>I knew a great Lady at Court which had the repute
of being over familiar with her reader and teacher,—so
much so indeed that one day Chicot, the King’s
<span class="no-wrap">jester,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92*]</a></span>
did openly reproach her therewith in presence of his
Majesty and many other personages of the Court, asking
her if she were not ashamed to have herself loved (saying
the word right out) of so ugly and base a loon as yonder
fellow, and if she had not wit to choose a better man.
The company hereon began to laugh uproariously and
the lady to weep, supposing that the King had abetted
the game; for strokes of the sort were quite in character
with his usual play. Other very great ladies and high
Princesses I have known, which every day would amuse
themselves with making their Secretaries, whom I have
likewise known, write, or rather pretend to write, and
have fine games. Or if they did not call for them to
write, having naught to say, then would they make them
read aloud, for to give a better colour to the whole
thing, declaring how reading themselves did weaken their
sight.</p>

<p>Great ladies which do make choice of suchlike paramours
be quite inexcusable and most blameworthy, seeing
they have their liberty of action, and full freedom and
opportunity to choose whom they will. But poor girls
which be abject slaves of father and mother, kinsfolk
and guardians and mistresses, and timid to boot, are
constrained to pick up any stone they can find for their
purpose, never thinking whether it be cold or hot, roast
or boiled. And so, according as occasion offer, they do
generally resort to their men-servants, to their school-master
and teacher, to fellows of the artist craft, lute-players,
fiddlers, dancing masters, painters, in a word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
their different instructors in knowledge and accomplishments,
and even sometimes preachers of religion and holy
monks, as Boccaccio doth describe and the Queen of
Navarre in her <i>Nouvelles</i>. The like is done by pages, as
myself have noted, lackeys, and especially stage-players,
with whom I have known two maids of honour desperately
in love and not scrupling to indulge the same. Poets too
I have known in some cases to have debauched fair maids,
wives and widows.</p>

<p>These do fondly love to be praised and worshipped,
and with this bait are caught, as indeed by almost any
they do find convenient and can attract to them. Lawyers
again be very dangerous folk in these matters.</p>

<p>Now note why ’tis Boccaccio and other writers with
him do find maids to be more constant in love and more
steadfast than wives or widows. ’Tis because they do
resemble persons afloat on a river in a sinking boat. They
that cannot swim at all do spring at the first branches
they can catch hold of, and do grasp these firmly and
obstinately till they see help arrive. Others that can
swim, do leap into the water and strike out boldly till
they have reached the bank. Even so young maids,
whenas they have gotten a lover, do hold and keep him
steadfastly, the one they have first chose, and will in no
wise let him go, but love him steadfastly. This cometh
of the dread that, having no free choice and proper opportunity,
they may not be able, an if they lose him,
to get another such as they would wish. Whereas married
women and widows, which do know the wiles of love
and are well experienced, and have full liberty and all
convenience to swim in all waters without danger, may
choose what mate they please; and if they weary of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
lover or lose him, why! they can straight get another, or
even take two. For with them ’tis ever a case of “one
lost, two got back.”</p>

<p>Beside, young girls have not the means, the money and
crown-pieces, to win them new lovers every day; for all
ever they can give their lovers is some small gift of a
lock of hair, a little seed pearl or so, a bracelet, a small
ring or a scarf, or other insignificant presents that cost
almost naught. For high-born as a girl may be (I have
seen it myself), and no matter of how great an house
and how rich an heiress, she is kept so short of money,
by father, mother, kinsfolk or guardians, as the case may
be, that she simply hath not the means to give much to
her lover, nor scarce ever to untie her purse widely,—unless
it be her purse in front. Besides, girls be of themselves
miserly, if for no other reason, yet because they
be forced to it, having scarce any means of extravagance;
for generosity in giving doth rest and depend above all on
the ability to gratify it. On the contrary wives and
widows can dispose of their wealth very freely, when they
have any; and above all, when they have fancied a man,
and be taken with passion and caprice for him, there is
naught they will not sell and give away to the very shift
on their back, rather than not have enjoyment of him.
Herein they are just like gluttons and folk that be slaves
of their mouths, who taking a fancy to a tid-bit, must
have the same, no matter what it cost them at the market.
Poor maids be in quite other case; whatsoever they can
get, be it good or bad, this must they stop and buy.</p>

<p>I could bring forward a whole host of their intrigues,
and their divers appetites and curious preferences. But
I should never get me done at that rate; beside what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
would such tales be worth, unless the subjects were given
by name and surname. But this is a thing I will not do
at any price, for I desire to bring shame on no woman; and
I have made profession to avoid in this my book all evil-speaking
whatsoever, so that none may have aught to
reproach me with on the score of scandal-mongering.
However to tell my tales, suppressing the names, in this
can be no harm. I do leave my readers to guess the persons
intended; and many a time they will suppose it to
be one, though all the while ’tis quite another.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">3.</p>

<p>Now just as we do see different sorts of wood
of such different nature, that some will burn
when quite green, as the ash and the beech,
but others, be they as dry, old and well seasoned
as you please, for instance the elm, the alder and
others, do burn only as slowly and tediously as possible,
while many others, following the general nature of all
dry and old wood, do blaze up in their dryness and oldness
so rapidly and suddenly ’tis rather a destroying and
instant reducing to ashes than burning proper, so is
the like true of women, whether maids, wives or widows.
Some, so soon as ever they be come to the first greenness
of their age, do burn so easily and well, you would say
from their very mother’s womb they do draw thence an
amorousness; as did the fair Laïs from her fair mother
Tymandra, that most famous harlot, and an hundred
thousand others which herein do take after the good
whores their mothers. Nay! sometimes they do not so
much as wait for the age of maturity, that may be put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
at twelve or thirteen, to begin loving, but are at it
sooner yet. This happened not twelve years agone at
Paris to a pastry-cook’s child, which was discovered to
be pregnant at nine years of
<span class="no-wrap">age.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span>
The girl being very
sick with her pregnancy, and her father having taken a
specimen of her urine to a physician, the latter said at
once she had no other sickness but only that she was
with child. “What!” cried the father; “Why, Sir! my
daughter is only nine years old.” Who so astonished as
the doctor? “’Tis all one,” said he; “of a surety, she
is with child.” And after examining her more closely,
he did indeed find her so. The child afterward confessing
with whom she had had to do, her gallant was condemned
to death by the judges, for having gone with her at so
very tender an age. I much regret I have come to give
this example and mention the thing here, seeing I had
made up my mind not to sully my paper with suchlike
mean folk, but to deal only with great and well-born
persons.</p>

<p>Herein I have somewhat gone wide of my purpose, but
the story being so rare and uncommon, I must e’en be
excused.</p>

<p>This doth remind me of a tale of a brave and gallant
Lord if ever there was one, since dead, which was one day
making complaint of the amplitude of women’s affairs
with whom he had had to do, as well maids as married
ladies. He declared ’twould come to his having to look
for mere children, just come from the cradle so to speak,
so as not to find so wide a space of open sea as he had done
with the rest, but get better pleasure by swimming in a
narrow strait. An if he had addressed these words to a
certain great and honourable dame I do know, she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
have made him the same answer she did to another gentleman
of the great world, to whom, on his making a like
complaint, she did retort thus: “I wot not which hath
better cause of complaint, you men of our width and over
amplitude, or we women of your tenuity and over smallness,
or rather your tiny, tiny littleness; truly we have
as much to lament in you as ever you in us.”</p>

<p>The lady was right enough in what she said. Similarly
another great lady, one day at Court looking curiously
at the great bronze Hercules in the fountain at Fontainebleau,
as she was a-walking with an honourable gentleman
which did escort her, his hand beneath her arm, did complain
that the said Hercules, albeit excellently well
wrought and figured otherwise, was not so well proportioned
in all his members as should be, forasmuch as his
middle parts were far too small and out of proper measure,
in no wise corresponding to his huge colossus of a
body. The gentleman replied he did not agree with what
she said, for ’twas to be supposed that in those days
ladies were not so wide as at the present.</p>

<p>A very great lady and noble
<span class="no-wrap">Princess<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span>
learning how
that certain folk had given her name to a huge great culverin,
did ask the reason why. Whereupon one present
answered: “’Tis for this, Madam, because it hath a calibre
greater and wider than all the rest.”</p>

<p><i>Si est-ce pourtant qu’elles y ont trouvé assez de remède,
et en trouvent tous les jours assez pour rendre leurs portes
plus étroites, carrées et plus malaisées d’entrée; dont aucunes
en usent, et d’autres non; mais nonobstant, quand
le chemin y est bien battu et frayé souvent par continuelle
habitation et fréquentation, ou passages d’enfants,
les ouvertures de plusieurs en sont toujours plus grandes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
et plus larges. Je me suis là un peu perdu et dévoyé;
mais puisque ç’a été à propos il n’y a point de mal, et je
retourne à mon chemin.</i></p>

<p>Many other young girls there be which let safely pass
this early, tender, sappy time of life, waiting a greater
maturity and dryness, whether because they be naturally
cold at first beginning and start, or that they be kept
close guarded, as is very needful with some. Others there
be so steadfast, the winds and tempests of winter would
avail naught to shake or stir them. Others again be so
foolish and simple-minded, so raw and ignorant, as that
they would not so much as hear the name of love. So
have I heard of a woman which did affect the virtuous
prude, that an if she did hear the word harlot mentioned,
she would instantly faint. A friend telling this story to
a certain great Lord in presence of his wife, the latter did
exclaim: “She’d better not come here, that woman; for
if she doth faint to hear speak of whores, she’ll die right
out to see one.”</p>

<p>On the other hand there be some girls which from the
first moment they begin to feel they have a heart, grow
so tame they will eat from the hand at once. Others be
so devout and scrupulous, fearing so sore the commandments
of the Lord our God, that they do quite neglect that
of love. Yet have I seen many of these same devout patterers
of prayers, these women that be forever a-kissing
of images and all but living in churches, which did under
this hypocritical veil cover and conceal the fire of their
passions, to the end that by such false and feigned semblance
the world might perceive never a trace of them,
but deem them perfect prudes, or even half way to being
saints like St. Catherine of Sienna, by the which professions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
they have often succeeded in deceiving all mankind.
Thus have I heard it related of a very great Princess, a
Queen indeed, now dead, who when she was fain to make
love to any man, (for she was exceeding given that way),
would invariably begin her conversation with the love we
do owe to God, and then suddenly bring it round to carnal
love, and what she did want of her interlocutor, whereof
she did before long come to the practice or quintessential
part. This is how these devotees, or bigots rather, do
cajole us men; such of us that is as be not well versed in
wiles of the sort and know not life.</p>

<p>I have heard a tale, though I wot not if it be true. Anyway
of late years, on occasion of a general procession at
a certain city, was seen a woman, well born or not, bare-footed
and in great contrition, playing the penitent with
might and main,—and it was in Lent. Straight from
there she hied her away to dine with her lover on a quarter
of kid and a ham. The savour did penetrate to the street,
and going up to her chamber, folk found her in the midst
of this glorious feast. She was arrested and condemned
to be led through the town with the joint on a spit over
her shoulder and the ham hanging at her neck. Was not
this a meet and proper punishment?</p>

<p>Other ladies there be so proud and haughty they do
scorn heaven and earth in a way of speaking, and utterly
snub and reject men and all their offers. But for such all
that is need is to wait and have patience and perseverance,
for with these and time you do surely subdue them
and find them humble enough at last, for ’tis the property
of highmindedness and pride, after much swelling and
exaltation, presently to come down and bate its lofty
claims. And with these same proud dames, I have seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
many instances where after scorning love and all that
spake to them thereof, they have given in and loved like
any others, or have even wedded husbands of mean estate
and in no way their equals. Thus doth Love make mock
of them and punish them for their hard-heartedness, taking
especial delight in attacking them more than other
folk, forasmuch as the victory is then a prouder one, as
vanquishing pride.</p>

<p>I knew erstwhile a Court damsel, so proud and scornful
that when some gallant man of the world would come
to address her and speak of love, she would ever answer
him so haughtily and with so great contempt, in words so
fierce and arrogant (for she had a gift of speech as good
as any), that presently they did cease altogether. But
an if any did chance now and again still to try and vanquish
her pride, ’twas a sight how she would snub them
and send them packing with words and looks and scornful
gestures; for she was very clever at this game. In
the end Love did surprise and sore punish her, for she
gave in to one which did get her with child some score
of days only before her marriage; yet was this lover in no
wise to be compared with many other honourable gentlemen
which had aforetime been fain to be her suitors.
Herein we can only say with Horace, <i>sic placet Veneri</i>,
“such is Venus’ pleasure,”—for these be miracles.</p>

<p>’Twas my humour once while at Court to be lover to a
fair and honorable damsel, accomplished and expert if
ever woman was, and of a very good house, but proud
and highhanded; and I was very much smit with her indeed.
I did make up my mind to court her, but alway
to deal with her in the same arrogant spirit she did use
in her words and answers to me,—as the proverb saith,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
“When Greek meets Greek.” Yet did she show no resentment
for all this, for indeed, all the while I was treating
her so cavalierly, I was used to praise her exceedingly,
seeing there is naught doth more soften a woman’s heart
than commendation whether of her beauty and charms or
of her proud spirit, even declaring how that her port did
much become her, forasmuch as she kept her from all
common familiarity, and that any woman, damsel or dame,
which did make her too common and familiar, not maintaining
a haughty port and high repute, was not worthy
to be so courted. For all which I did but respect her the
more, and would never call her by any other name but
<i>my lady Disdain</i>. Whereat she was so well pleased she
did herself likewise choose to call me always <i>Master Arrogance</i>.</p>

<p>So ever continuing, I did court her long and faithfully;
and I may boast me I had as large a share of her
good graces as any great Lord at Court which did care
to court her, or larger. However a chief favourite of the
King, a brave and gallant gentleman without a doubt, did
take her from me, and by favour of his King did win and
marry her. Natheless, so long as she did live, the connection
was ever kept up betwixt us, and I have always
honoured her well. I know not an if I shall be blamed
for having told this tale, for ’tis a common saying that
all tales about a man’s self be bad. Anyway I have let
it out this time; as indeed throughout my book I have
related not a few stories of myself in divers relations,
though I do generally suppress the name.</p>

<p>Other girls there be again of so merry a complexion
and so lighthearted, so devoted to amusement and enjoyment,
they never have another thought in their heads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
but to laugh, and make sport and pastime, and never time
to hear or dream of anything else but only their little
amusements. I have known many such which had rather
hear a fiddle play, or dance or leap or run, than hearken
to any love discourse whatsoever; while other some do
so adore the chase they should better be called servants
of Diana than of Venus. I did once know a brave and
valiant Lord, since dead, which fell so deep in love with
a maid, and a great lady to boot, that he was like to die;
“for whenas I am fain,” he used to say, “to declare my
passion, she doth answer me never a word but about her
dogs and her hunting. I would to heaven I were metamorphosed
into a hunting-dog or greyhound, and my
soul entered in their body, according to Pythagoras’
opinion, to the end she might give some heed to my love,
and I be healed of my wound.” Yet afterward did he leave
her, for he was not good lackey or huntsman enough to
go everywhere a-following her about, wherever her lusty
humours, her pleasures and amusements might lead her.</p>

<p>Yet must we note one fact. Maids of this sort, after
leaving their chickenhood behind and outgrowing the pip,
(as we say of poultry), having taken their fill of these
childish amusements, do always come, at long last, to essay
a woman’s pleasures too. Such young girls do resemble
little wolf-cubs, which be so pretty, engaging and
playful in their downy youth; yet being come to maturity,
they do ever take to evil courses and ravening and killing.
The sort of girls I am speaking of do ever the like,
who after much sport and youthful merriment, after
pleasures of all kinds, hunting, dancing, leaping, skipping
and jigging, do always, I ween, indulge at last in
dame Venus’ gentle sport. In a word, to put it briefly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
scarce ever a one of the sex is seen, maid, wife or widow,
but sooner or later she and all her sisters do burn, in
season or out of season,—as do all woods, excepting only
one, yclept the <i>larix</i>, the which they do in no wise resemble.</p>

<p>Now this Larix is a wood which will never burn, and
maketh neither fire, flame nor ash, as Julius Cæsar did
find. On his return back from Gaul, he had ordered the
inhabitants of Piedmont to furnish him vivers, and establish
magazines on his main line of march. He was duly
obeyed, except by the garrison of a castle called <i>Larignum</i>,
whither had withdrawn certain ill-disposed rascals,
recusants and rebels, the result being Cæsar had to turn
back and besiege the place. Coming nigh the fortress, he
saw its defences were only of wood, whereat he did
straightway make mock, deeming they would immediately
take the same. Wherefore he did give orders at once to
collect large plenty of fagots and straw to set fire to the
bulwarks, and soon was there so huge a conflagration and
mass of flame that all hoped soon to see the ruin and
destruction of the fort. But lo! whenas the fire was
burned out and the flame disappeared, all were exceeding
astonished, for they beheld the stronghold in the same
state as before and quite unhurt, neither burned nor
ruined one whit. This did compel Cæsar to resort to
other means, mining to wit, which did at last bring those
within to come to terms and render up the place. From
this Cæsar did learn the virtues of this larix-wood, from
the which the castle had its name of <i>Larignum</i>, because
it was built and defended of the same.</p>

<p>I ween there be many fathers, mothers, kinsmen and
husbands, that would dearly like their daughters and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
wives should share the properties of this wood, that they
should burn fiercely without its leaving mark or effect
behind. They would have a far more unruffled mind and
not so many suspicions a-buzzing in their heads, nor
would there be so many whores on show nor cuckolds before
the world. But ’tis not really desirable in any shape
or form, for the world would be clean depopulated, and
folk would live therein like blocks of stone, without pleasure
or satisfaction. So many persons I wot of, of either
sex, would say; and indeed Nature would be left imperfect,
instead of very perfect as she is. Following her
kindly lead as our best captain, we need never fear to lose
the right path.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Well!</span> enough said of maids; ’tis but right we
now proceed to speak of widows in their turn.</p>

<p>The love of widows is good, easy and advantageous,
seeing they be in full liberty of action,
and in no sense slaves of fathers, mothers, brothers, kinsmen
and husbands, nor yet of any legal bar, a still more
important point. A man may make love and lie with a
widow as much as ever he please, he is liable to no penalty,
as he is with maids or married women. In fact the Romans,
which people hath given us the most of the laws
we have, did never make this act punishable, either in
person or property. I have this from a great lawyer, who
did cite Papinian for confirmation of the point, that
great Roman jurisconsult, who treating of adultery declares;
if occasionally under this term adultery hath been
inadvertently included lawless intercourse with maid or
widow, ’tis a misuse of words. In another passage the
same authority saith: the heir hath no right of reproach
or concern with the character of the deceased man’s
widow, except only if the deceased had in his lifetime
brought action against his wife on this ground; then
could the said heir take up and carry on the prosecution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
but not otherwise. And as a fact in all the whole of
Roman law is no penalty ordained for the widow, except
only for one that did marry again within the year of her
mourning, or who without re-marrying had borne a child
subsequently to the eleventh month of her first year of
widowhood, this first year being deemed sacred to the
honour of her former husband. There was likewise a law
made by Heliogabalus, that no widow must marry again
for one year after the death of her husband, to the end
she might have due leisure to bewail his loss and deliberate
carefully on the choice of a successor. A truly paternal
law, and an excellent reason i’ faith! As for a widow’s
original dowry, the heir could not in any case rob her
thereof, even though she should have given her person
to every possible form of naughtiness. And for this my
authority did allege a very good reason; for the heir
having no other thought but only the property, if once
a door were opened to him to accuse the widow in hope of
making her forfeit this and so rob her of her dowry, she
would be exposed at once to every calumny his malignity
could invent. So there would be never a widow, no matter
how virtuous and unoffending, could safeguard her from
slanderous actions on the part of enterprising heirs.</p>

<p>All this would seem to show, I think, that the Roman
ladies did have good opportunities and occasion for self-indulgence.
No need then to be astonished if one of them,
in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, (as is found writ in that
Emperor’s life), as she was walking in her husband’s
funeral procession, and in the midst of all her cries, sobs,
sighs, tears and lamentations, did so strictly press the
hand of the gentleman which was her escort, as to surely
signify thereby her willingness for another taste of love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
and marriage. Accordingly at the end of a year,—for he
could not marry her before, without a special dispensation,
as was done for Pompey whenas he did wed Cæsar’s daughter,
but this was scarce ever given but to the greatest
personages,—he did marry the lady, having meantime
enjoyed some dainty foretastes, and picked many an early
loaf out of the batch, as the saying goes. Mighty fain
was this good lady to lose naught by procrastination, but
take her measures in good time; yet for all this, she did
lose never a doit of her property and original dowry.</p>

<p>Thus fortunate were Roman widows,—as are still in
the main their French sisters, which for giving heart and
fair body satisfaction, do lose naught of their rights;
albeit several cases hereanent have been pleaded before
our parliaments. Thus I wot of a great and wealthy
French Lord, which did carry on a long process against
his sister-in-law concerning her dowry, charging her that
her life had been lascivious and with another crime of a
less gay sort to boot. Natheless did she win her case;
and the brother-in-law was obliged to dower her handsomely
and give her all that did belong to her. Yet was
the governance of her son and daughter taken from her,
seeing she had married again. This the judges and noble
councillors of the parliaments do look to, forbidding
widows that re-marry to have guardianship of their children.
In spite of this I do know of widows which within
the last few years have successfully asserted their rights,
though re-married, over their daughters being under age,
against their brothers-in-law and other kinsmen; but then
they were greatly helped by the influence of the Prince
which was their protector. Indeed there is never a law a
fine <i>motte</i> cannot traverse. Of these subjects I do now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
refrain me from speaking more, seeing ’tis not my trade;
so thinking to say something mighty clever, ’tis very
like I may say what is quite from the point. I do refer me
to our great men of the law.</p>

<p>Now of our widows some be alway glad to try marriage
once again and run its risks, like mariners that twice,
thrice and four times saved from shipwreck do again and
again go back to the sea, and as married women do, which
in the pains of motherhood do swear and protest they will
never, never go back to it again, and no man shall ever be
aught to them, yet no sooner be they sound and clean
again, but they take to the same old dance once more. So
a Spanish lady, being in her pangs, had a candle lighted
in honour of Our Lady of Mont-Sarrat, who much succours
women in child-birth. Yet did she fail not to have
sore pain and swear right earnestly she would never go
back to it any more. She was no sooner delivered but
turning to her woman who held the candle still alight, she
said, <i>Serra esto cabillo de candela para otra vez</i>, “Put
away that bit of candle for another time.”</p>

<p>Other ladies do prefer not to marry; and of these are
always some, and always have been, which coming to be
widows in the flower of their age, be content to stay so.
Ourselves have seen the Queen Mother, which did become
a widow at the age of seven or eight and thirty years, and
did ever after keep that state; and fair, pleasant and
agreeable as she was, did never so much as think of any
man to be her second husband. No doubt it may be said
on the other side,—Whom could she have wedded suitable
to her lofty estate and comparable with the great King
Henri, her late lord and master; beside she would thereby
have lost the government of the Kingdom, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
better worth than an hundred husbands, and its enjoyment
more desirable and pleasant? Yet is there no advantage
Love doth not make women forget; wherefore
she is the more to be commended and worthy to be recorded
in the temple of fame and immortality. For she did master
and command her passions,—not like another Queen, which
unable to restrain herself, did wed her own steward of the
household, by name the Sieur de
<span class="no-wrap">Rabodanges.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95*]</a></span>
This the
King, her son, did at first beginning find exceeding strange
and bitter; but yet, because she was his mother, he did
excuse and pardon the said Rabodanges for having married
her; and it was arranged that by day, before the
world, he should serve her alway as steward, not to deprive
her, being the King’s mother, of her proper state and dignity,
but by night she should make of him what pleased
her, using him either as servant or master at her choice,
this being left to their own discretion and good pleasure.
We may readily imagine who was master then; for every
woman, be she as high-born as she may, coming to this
point, is ever subject to the superior male, according to
the law of nature and humanity in this matter. I have the
tale from the late Grand Cardinal de Lorraine, second of
the name and title, which did tell it at Poissy to King
Francis II., the time he did institute the eighteen knights
of the Order of Saint Michael,—a very great number,
and one never seen or heard of before
<span class="no-wrap">then.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96*]</a></span>
Among
others was the Seigneur de Rabodanges, a very old man,
that had not been seen for years at Court, except on occasion
of some of our warlike expeditions, he having
withdrawn soon after the death of M. de Lautrec out of
disappointment and despite, a common enough case, having
lost his good master, the Captain of whose Guard he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
was, on his journey to the Kingdom of Naples, where he
died. And the Cardinal did further say he did believe
this M. de Rabodanges was descended of the marriage in
question.—Some while agone a lady of France did marry
her page, so soon as ever his pagehood was expired and
he his own master, thinking she had worn her widow’s
weeds quite long enough.</p>

<p>Well, to leave this sort of widows, and say somewhat
of more high-minded and prudent dames.</p>

<p>We have had our Queen of France, Donna Isabelle
of Austria, which was wife to the late King Charles IX.,
whom we may in all ways declare to have been one of the
best, gentlest, wisest and most virtuous Queens that ever
reigned of all the Kings and Queens that ever were. This
I may confidently affirm, and every one that hath ever
seen her or heard her speak will say the same, and this
without disparaging others and with the most perfect
truth. She was a very beautiful Princess, with features
and face as fair and delicate as any lady at the Court,
and most affable. Her figure too was very fine, albeit
she did scarce reach the middle height. She was very sensible
and prudent moreover, most virtuous and good-natured,
and one that did never hurt or displeasure any,
or give offence by so much as the smallest word. And indeed
she was very careful of her speech, saying but very
little and alway in her native Spanish.</p>

<p>She was truly pious, but no wise bigoted, not overmuch
manifesting her religion by outward acts and shows, and
an extremity of devotion, such as I have seen some of our
prayer-patterers display, but rather without missing any
of the regular hour for supplication to God, she did
employ these well and sufficiently, without going out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
her way to borrow other extraordinary ones. ’Tis very
true, as I have heard some of her ladies declare, that
whenas she was to bed apart and hid, and her curtains
close drawn, she would kneel there devoutly in her shift
and make prayer to God by the space of an hour and a
half, beating and tormenting her breast in her zeal of
devotion.</p>

<p>This habit had never been noted at all till after the
death of King Charles her husband. But one night after
she had gone to bed and all her women were retired,
one of those which did sleep in her chamber, hearing her
sighing, did bethink her to peep between the curtains, and
saw her in the posture described, so praying and beseeching
God, which practice she did continue well nigh every
evening. At length the said bedchamber-woman, who was
on very familiar terms with her, did venture to remonstrate
one day with her on the ground she was hurting
her health. The Queen was angered against the woman
for her discovery and advice, and fain almost to deny the
thing, and did straitly charge her to breathe never a word
about it. Wherefore for that evening she did desist; but
in the night she did fully make up for it, supposing her
women would not observe it. But they saw her, and found
how it was, by the reflexion of her chamber-light of wax,
the which she did keep burning by her bedside next the
wall, for to read in her Book of Hours and pray God
at whiles, using for this pious purpose the same space
where other Queens and Princesses do keep their table of
refection. Suchlike prayers do little resemble those of
hypocrites, which wishing to appear religious before the
world, do make their orisons and devotions publicly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
aye with mumbling of the lips, to the end folk may deem
them exceeding devout and sanctified.</p>

<p>Thus would our good Queen pray for the soul of the
King, her husband, whom she did sorely grieve for, yet all
the whole making her moan and lamentation not like a wild
and desperate woman, screaming, and tearing her cheeks
and hair, nor yet merely counterfeiting one that is commended
for her tears, but sorrowing gently, dropping her
fair and precious tears so tenderly, sighing so soft and low,
as that ’twas plain to see she was restraining her grief all
she could, to the end people might not think her desirous
of making a fine seeming and grand impression (a thing I
have seen many ladies do in such case), yet failing not at
all to convince all of the deep anguish of her heart. Even
so a torrent is ever more violent whose course is stayed
than when it hath free space to run in. I do well remember
me how, all through the King’s malady, her dear lord
and husband, he lying in his bed and she coming to visit
him, she would quick sit her down by his side, not close to
his bed’s-head, as is usual, but a little withdrawn, yet
within his sight, where remaining without speaking scarce
at all to him, or he to her, she would keep her eyes all the
while so fixed upon him, that never taking them from off his
face she did verily seem to be warming him in her heart with
the heat of all the love she bare him. Presently she might
be seen dropping tears so soft and secret, that any which
had not chanced to note them, would have never known her
grief. There would she sit, drying her wet eyes under pretence
of using her handkerchief, that ’twas downright
pity to every soul there (I saw the thing myself) to see
her so troubled to hide her grief and love, and prevent the
King from seeing the signs of her sorrow. Such was ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
her practise in her husband’s sickness; whereafter she
would rise and hie her to her prayers for his restoration
to health. She did truly love and honour him exceedingly,
albeit she knew him of amorous complexion and that
he had mistresses, whether for his renown or for his
pleasure. But yet was she never a whit less kind, nor ever
said an ill word to him, patiently bearing her little load
of jealousy and the wrong he did her. She was a very
meet and proper mate for him; for ’twas indeed fire
and water come together in one, the King being naturally
quick, hot and stirring, she cool and temperate in all
things.</p>

<p>I have been told on good authority, how that after her
widowhood, among certain of her more privy ladies, which
were for giving her such consolation as they could suggest,
was one (for, as you may suppose, among so great a band
there will alway be one more maladroit than the rest),
which, thinking to please highly, did address her thus:
“At least, Madam, an if instead of a daughter he had but
left you a son, you would at this moment be the King’s
Queen Mother, and your dignity by so much increased and
strengthened.”—But her answer was: “Alas! alas! say
not such a thing. As if France had not misfortunes
enough already, without my having caused yet another to
be her utter ruin. For had I had a son, this would only
have mean more factions, troubles and seditions for to get
the care and guardianship of the young King during his
infancy and minority. Hence would have sprung more
war and strife than ever, each striving to make his profit
and draw advantage by plundering the poor child, as they
were fain to do to the late King, my husband, and would
have done but for the Queen, his mother, and his good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
servants which did oppose such doings. But an if I had
had a son, I should have but found unhappiness in the
thought of having borne him, and gotten a thousand
maledictions of the people, whose voice is the voice of
God. Wherefore I tell you I do praise my God, and am
right thankful for the fruit he hath vouchsafed me, be
it for better or for worse to me in the end.” Such was
the kindness of this good-hearted Princess toward the
country of her adoption.</p>

<p>I have likewise heard tell how at the massacre of the
Saint Bartholomew, the Queen, knowing naught of it and
having never the least suspicion in the world of what was
plotting, did get her to bed in her usual fashion. On her
waking in the morning, she was first thing informed of the
fine mystery that was a-playing. “Woe is me!” she did
cry out instantly, “the King, my husband, doth he know
of it?”—“Of a surety, Madam,” came the answer; “’tis
he that doth order it.”—“Great God,” she cried in horror,
“what thing is this? and what counsellors be they which
have given him this advice? Oh, God! I do beseech and
pray thee to pardon this sin, for an if Thou be not pitiful,
this offence, I fear me sore, is beyond all pardon.”
Then she did quick ask for her Book of Hours, and so
to prayers and supplication to the Almighty, the tears
dropping from her eyes.</p>

<p>Prithee consider the wisdom and goodness the said Queen
did manifest in not approving of such a merrymaking and
the cruel game that was played thereat, and this although
she had much cause to desire the utter extermination of the
Admiral (Coligny) and his fellow religionists, seeing they
were absolutely opposed in every way to her own faith, the
which she did adore and honour more than aught else in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
the world, and on the other hand because she could plainly
see how they did trouble the Kingdom of her gracious lord
and husband. Moreover the Emperor her father had
actually said to her, as she was setting forth with him on
her way to France: “My daughter,” he said, “you are
going as Queen to a Kingdom the fairest, strongest and
most puissant in the world, and so far I do hold you a very
happy woman. Yet would you be happier still, an if you
could but find it at peace within its borders and as flourishing
as erstwhile it was used to be. But you will actually
find it sorely torn, dismembered, divided and weakened,
for albeit the King, your future husband, is on the right
side, yet the Princes and Lords of the Protestant faith do
much hurt and injury on the other.” And indeed she did
find it even as he said.</p>

<p>Being now a widow, many of the most clear-sighted folk
I wot of at Court, both men and women, did deem the new
King, on his arrival back from Poland, would marry her,
in spite of the fact she was his sister-in-law. But then
he could well do so by virtue of the Pope’s dispensation,
who can do much in this respect, and especially where
great personages be concerned, in view of the public
advantage involved. And there were many reasons for
concluding the said marriage, the which I have left to
more authoritative writers than myself to deduce, without
my alleging them here. But amongst others one of the
chiefest was to recognise by the marriage the great
obligations the King lay under to the Emperor on the
occasion of his quitting Poland for to return to France.
For there can be no reasonable doubt, an if the Emperor
had chose to put the smallest obstacle in his path, he
would never have been able to get away and cross the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
frontier and make his way to France. The Poles were
anxious to keep him, only he did leave them without ever
a farewell; while the Germans were on the watch on every
side to capture him (as was done to the gallant King
Richard of England, on his return from the Holy Land,
as we read in our Chronicles), and would have certainly
held him prisoner and made him pay ransom, or maybe
worse. For they were exceeding sore with him, for the
sake of the Feast of Saint Bartholomew,—or at any rate
the Protestant Princes were. However, he did voluntarily
and without ceremony throw himself suddenly on the protection
of the Emperor, which did receive him very graciously
and lovingly, and with great honour and much
gracious familiarity, as if the twain had been brothers.
Then presently, after he had tarried with him some days,
he did in person convoy him a day or two’s journey on
his way, and give him a perfectly safe passage through his
dominions, so by his favour he did eventually win to Carinthia,
the Venetian territories, Venice itself, and presently
his own kingdom.</p>

<p>Such was the obligation the King of France lay under
to the Emperor, one which many persons, as I have said,
did suppose the former would have paid back by binding
yet firmer his alliance with him. But at the time he went
into Poland, he had seen at Blamont in Lorraine, the fair
Louise de Lorraine, Mademoiselle de Vaudémont, one of
the most beautiful, virtuous and accomplished Princess
in all Christendom. On her he did cast such ardent eyes
as that being presently inflamed with deepest love, and
keeping his passion warm all the while he was away, he did
straightway on his return to Lyons despatch M. du
<span class="no-wrap">Gua,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97*]</a></span>
one of his chiefest favourites (as truly he did in every way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
deserve to be), to Lorraine. Arrived there, he did settle
and conclude the match betwixt him and her very easily and
with no great disputing, as you may well imagine, such
good fortune being beyond the utmost hopes of him and
his daughter,—the one to be father-in-law of the King of
France, the other to be Queen of that Realm. Of this
Princess I do propose to speak elsewhere.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">2.</p>

<p>To return once more to our little Queen. Wearied
of a longer tarrying in France for sundry
reasons, and in especial because she was not
properly respected and appreciated there as
she did deserve to be, she did resolve to go finish out the
remainder of her virtuous days with the Emperor, her
father, and the Empress, her mother. During her residence
at their Court, the Catholic King was widowed of
his Queen, Anne of Austria, own sister of the said French
Queen Elisabeth. The latter he would fain have married
and did send to beg the Empress, who was sister of the said
Catholic King, to open the first proposals to that effect.
But she would never hearken, once, twice or three times
that her mother spake to her of the matter, appealing to
the ashes of the late King, her husband, the which she
declared she would never insult by a second marriage,
and likewise alleging the over close consanguinity and
near relationship which was betwixt the two, whereby the
marriage might well anger God sorely. Whereupon the
Empress and the King her brother did bethink them to
have a Jesuit Father, a very learned and very eloquent
man, speak with her, who did exhort and sermonize her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
all ever he could, not forgetting to quote all the most telling
passages of Holy Scripture of every sort that might
advance his object. But the Queen did straight confound
him with other as good and more appropriate quotations,
for since her widowhood she had applied her earnestly
to the study of God’s Word, alleging moreover her
fixed determination, which was her chiefest bulwark, never
to forget her husband in a second marriage. The end was
the Jesuit came back with naught accomplished. However,
being strongly urged there by letters from the King of
Spain, he did return once again to the attack, not content
with the firm answer he had already had of the said
Princess. The latter, unwilling to waste more time in vain
contest with him, did treat him to some strong words and
actual menaces, cutting him short with the warning that
if he would persist in deafening her any more with the
matter, she would make him repent his interference, even
threatening she would have him whipped in her kitchen.
I have further heard tell,—I know not with how much
truth,—that, the man having attacked her for the third
time, she went beyond threats, and had him chastised
for his insolence. But this I do not believe, seeing she
did too well love folk of holy life, such as these men be.</p>

<p>Such was the constancy and noble firmness of this virtuous
Queen,—a constancy she did keep unbroken to the
end of her days, ever honouring the sacred ashes of her
<span class="no-wrap">husband.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98*]</a></span>
Faithfully did she water these with her mournful
tears, whose fountain at the last drying up, she did
succumb to her sorrow and die very young. She could
not have been more than five and thirty at her decease,—truly
a quite inestimable loss, for she might long have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
been a mirror of virtue to all honourable ladies throughout
Christendom.</p>

<p>And verily, showing as she did the love she bare the
King, her husband, by her constancy, virtuous continence
and unceasing plaints, she did manifest the same even more
finely toward the Queen of Navarre, her sister-in-law.
For knowing her to be in great extremity of distress, and
reduced to live in a remote Castle of
<span class="no-wrap">Auvergne,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99*]</a></span>
all but
deserted of all her friends and followers and by the most
part of those she had erstwhile obliged, she did send to
greet her and offer her every assistance. In fact she did
presently give her one-half of all her jointure which she
did enjoy in France, sharing with her as if she had been
her own proper sister. They say indeed this high-born
Queen would have had no little hardship to endure but
for this great liberality of her good and gentle kinswoman.
Accordingly she did pay her great respect, loving and
honouring her so well she had all the difficulty in the world
to bear her death with proper patience. Indeed, for
twenty days running she did keep her bed, weeping and
crying and making continual moan; and ever after did
naught but regret and deplore her loss, devoting to her
memory the noblest words, such that there could be
no need to borrow better to praise her withal and keep
her remembrance immortally green. I have been told
further that Queen Elisabeth too did compose and indite
a work of such beauty it cometh near God’s own word,
as also one containing the history of all that did hap in
France while she was in that country. I know not if
this be true, but I have been assured the book was seen
in the hands of the Queen of Navarre, as though it had
been sent her as a last present before the other’s death.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
’Twas most highly thought on of her, and pronounced
a most admirable production. At the word of so noble
and divine an oracle, what can we do but believe ’twas
verily so?</p>

<p>Such then is the summary account I have been able to
give of our good Queen Elisabeth, of her kindness, virtue,
constancy and faithfulness, and her true and loyal love
toward the King, her husband. And ’twas but her nature
to be so good and virtuous (I have heard M. de
<span class="no-wrap">Lansac,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100*]</a></span>
who was in Spain when she died, tell how the Empress
said to him on that occasion, <i>El mejor de nosotros es
muerto</i>,—“The best of us all is dead”), and we may well
believe how in such actions this Queen was but for
imitating her own mother, her great aunts and aunts.
For the Empress, her mother, albeit she was left a widow
when still quite young and very handsome, would never
marry again, but did ever after continue in her widowhood,
right wisely and steadfastly, having quitted Austria
and Germany, the scene of her rule, after the death of the
Emperor, her husband. She went to join her brother in
Spain, having been summoned of him and besought to go
thither to help him in the heavy burden of his affairs. This
she did, for indeed she was a very prudent and well-counselled
Princess. I have heard the late King Henri III.,
who was more skilled in reading character than any other
man in all his Kingdom, declare she was in his opinion
one of the most honourable, wise and accomplished Princesses
in the world.</p>

<p>On this, her journey to Spain, after passing through
the divers States of Germany, she did presently arrive at
Genoa in Italy, where she embarked. But seeing ’twas in
winter, in the month of December, that she took ship, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
storm did overtake her at Marseilles, at which port she
was forced to cast anchor in the roads. Yet would she
never come within the harbour, she or her galleys, for fear
of giving any ground for umbrage or suspicion; nor did
herself enter the town but only once, to see the sights.
Off this port she did tarry seven or eight days, a-waiting
for fair weather. Her most favourite course was every
morning to leave her galley (for she did usually sleep
a-board), and so during the day to go hear the service of
mass at the Church of St. Victor with very devout attention.
Then presently, her dinner having been brought and
made ready in the Abbey, she would there dine; after which
she would indulge in discourse with her ladies, or her folk
generally, or else with divers gentlemen of Marseilles,
which did show her all the honour and respect due to so
noble a Princess, the King of France indeed having bid
them specially to receive her as it were his own kingly person
in recompense for the good welcome and excellent
cheer she had given him at Vienna. This she did readily
enough perceive; and for that reason would converse very
intimately with them and show herself exceeding condescending,
treating them more after the German and
French fashion than the Spanish. In fact they were no
less delighted with her than she with them, and did write
a most courteous letter to the King, thanking him and
informing him they were as worthy and honourable folk
as ever she had seen in any place. Moreover she did
make separate mention by name of some score or so
of them, among whom was M. Castellan, known as the
Seigneur Altyvity, Captain of the King’s Galleys, a
man much renowned for having wedded the fair Chasteauneuf,
a Court lady, and for having killed the Grand Prior,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
himself falling along with him, as I do hope to relate in
another place. It was none other than his wife which did
relate to me what I here set down, and did tell me of all
the perfections of this noble Princess, and how pleasant
she did find her enforced stay at Marseilles, and how she
admired and enjoyed the place in her walks abroad. But
evening once come, she did never fail to return to sleep
on board her galley, to the end, the moment fine weather
and a favourable wind should come, she might straight
make sail, or mayhap because she was anxious to give no
cause of umbrage. I was at Court at the time these facts
were reported to the King concerning her passing visit,
who was most anxious to know if she had been well received,
and how she was, and did wish her well in all respects.
The said Princess is yet alive, and doth continue in her
good and virtuous behaviour, having done her brother
excellent service, by all I am told. She did later retire for
her final abode and dwelling-place to a Convent of religious
women, called the <i>descalçadas</i> (unshod), because they do
wear neither shoes nor stockings. This house was founded
by her sister, the Princess of Spain.</p>

<p>This same Princess of Spain was a very beautiful lady
in her day, and of a most courtly
<span class="no-wrap">dignity.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101*]</a></span>
Else truly she
would not have been a Spanish Princess; for of a surety,
fine bearing and becoming grace do ever go along with
Royalty, and above all with Spanish Royalty. Myself
have had the honour of seeing her and speaking with her
on terms of some intimacy, whenas I was in Spain after
my return from Portugal. The first time I went to pay
my duty to our Queen Elisabeth of France, and was discoursing
with her, answering her many questions as to
the news from France and Portugal, they came to inform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the Queen that the Princess of Spain was coming in.
Instantly she said to me: “Nay! do not retire, Monsieur
de Bourdeille; you will see a very fair and noble Princess,
and will find pleasure in so doing. She will be very
glad to see you and to ask you news of the King, her
son, as you have just lately seen him.” Hereupon cometh
the Princess herself, whom I thought exceeding handsome,
and in my opinion very becomingly attired, on her head
a Spanish cap of white crêpe, coming low down in a
point over the face, but not otherwise in widow’s weeds,
according to the Spanish fashion, for indeed her almost
constant wear was silk. At first I did gaze long at her
and admire her beauty, till just as I was growing quite
enthralled, the Queen did call me up, and told me the
Princess was fain to hear news of me concerning the King
her son; for I had already overheard the Queen informing
her how she had but now been conversing with a gentleman
of the King’s, late come from Portugal. At this, I came
forward, and did kiss her gown in the Spanish mode,
whereupon she did greet me very graciously and familiarly,
and began asking me news of the King, her son, his behaviour,
and what I thought of him. For at the time
a proposed match was being talked of betwixt him and
the noble Princess Marguerite of France, the King’s sister
and now Queen of Navarre. I did give her abundance of
information; for in those days I did speak Spanish as well
as my native French, or even better. Among other questions,
she did ask me, “Was her son handsome, and who
was he most like?” I told her he was one of the handsomest
Princes in Christendom, as truly he was, and that
he was like her in every way, and the living image of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
beauty, whereat she gave a little smile and blush, plainly
showing her pleasure at what I had said.</p>

<p>After we had conversed a long while together, the
Queen’s attendants came to summon her to supper, and so
the two sisters separated. Then did the Queen say to me
(she had been amusing herself at the window, yet had
heard most of what we said), with a laugh: “You did
please her mightily by what you said as to the likeness
betwixt her son and her.” Presently she asked what I
thought of her, and if I did not think her a noble lady,
and such as she had described her, and anon remarked:
“I imagine she would be right glad to wed the King, my
brother, and I should dearly love it.” All this I did duly
report later to the Queen Mother, when I was returned
back to the French Court, which was at the time at Arles
in Provence. But she did declare the Princess was too old
for him, old enough to be his mother. I informed her
moreover of what I had been told in Spain, and did consider
of good authority, to wit that she was firm resolved
never to marry again, an it were not to wed the King
of France, or failing this to withdraw from the world
altogether.</p>

<p>And truly she did grow so enamoured of this high match
and fair prospect, for she was of high heart and ambition,
and she did firmly believe she was approaching its accomplishment,
or failing this, was resolved to end her days in
the convent I have spoken of, where already she was having
buildings constructed against her possible retirement from
the world. Accordingly she did long cling to this hope and
belief, ever wisely maintaining her widowhood, till she did
learn of the King’s marriage with her niece. Then, all her
hopes frustrated, she did pronounce these words expressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
of despite or something like it, as I have been told: <i>Aunque
la nieta sea por su verano mas moza, y menos cargada de
años que la tia, la hermosura de la tia, ya en su estio
toda hecha y formada por sus gentiles y fructiferos años,
vale mas que todos los frutos que su edad florescida da
esperanza à venir; porque la menor desdicha humana los
harà caer y perder ni mas ni menos que alguinos arboles,
los quales, en el verano, por sus lindas y blancos flores
nos prometen linda fruta en el estio, y el menor viento
que acade los lleva y abate, no quedando que las hojas.
Ea! dunque pasase todo con la voluntad de Dios, con el
qual desde agora me voy, no con otro, para siempre
jamas, me casar</i>,—“True the niece is younger and in her
first prime, and less advanced in years than the aunt, yet
is the beauty of the latter, already in its summer glory,
fully grown and formed by the gracious years, and bearing
fruit, better worth than all the fruits that the other’s age,
now but beginning to bloom, doth give expectation of.
For the smallest human accident will destroy the same,
withering and ruining them, just like trees in the springtime,
which by their fair white blossoms do promise us
fair and excellent fruits in summer. But let only a little
blast of wind arise, and lo! they be broken off and beaten
down and spoiled, and naught left but only leaves. Well!
God’s will be done, with whom I am about to wed for all
eternity, and with no human bridegroom at all.” So said,
so done; and thereafter she did lead a life so good and
holy, altogether removed from the wicked world, as that
she hath left behind to all ladies, great and small, a noble
example for their imitation.</p>

<p>Some folks might possibly say, “Well! God be thanked
she could not marry King Charles; for be sure, and if this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
could have been brought about, she would have sent far
enough the hard life of a widow, and been right glad to
take up again the soft and pleasant one of a wife.” This
may well be allowed; but this likewise it must be granted
on the other hand, that the great wish she did display to
wed this puissant Monarch was but a manifestation of her
proud and ambitious Spanish heart, for to show her high
spirit, and prove she would in no wise take a lowly place;
but seeing her sister an Empress, not able to be one too,
yet fain to rival her, she did therefore aspire to be Queen
of the realm of France, which is as good as any Empire, or
better, and, if not in actual fact, yet in will and desire to
be on an equal footing with her. Such motives do well
accord with her character, as I have heard it described.
To make an end, she was in mine opinion one of the most
noble and high-bred foreign Princesses I have ever seen,
albeit she may perhaps be reproached with her retirement
from the world, due rather to despite than to genuine
devotion. Yet she did thus piously withdraw her; and
her good life and holy have sufficiently made manifest the
true sanctity of her character.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">3.</p>

<p>Her aunt, Queen Mary of Hungary, did the like,
but at a very advanced age, and this no less
from her own desire to retire from the world
than in order to help her brother the Emperor
to serve God well and piously. This same Queen was
widowed at a very early age, having lost King Louis, her
husband, which fell very young in a battle he fought with
the Turks,—a battle he should never of rights have lost,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
but for the obstinacy of a Cardinal, which had much influence
over him and did over-persuade him against his
better judgement, declaring ’twas not meet to distrust
God’s power and a righteous cause. Though he should
have but ten thousand Hungarians, more or less, on his
side, yet these being all good Christians and fighting in
God’s quarrel, he should easily rout ten thousand Turks.
In fine he did so incite and push him to recklessness, as
that he did lose the battle; and presently attempting to
retreat was entangled in a marsh and there choked.</p>

<p>The same fate befell the last King of Portugal, Don
<span class="no-wrap">Sebastian,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102*]</a></span>
which did perish miserably, having risked battle
with too weak a force against the Moors, that were three
times as strong as himself. This was done through the
advice, preaching and obstinacy of sundry Jesuits, which
were forever alleging the power of Almighty God, who
with a look could strike a whole host dead, above all when
this was banded together against him. An excellent and
a true doctrine doubtless; yet must we not be over confident
and abuse God’s promises, for His secret purpose
will alway be past our finding out. Some say the Jesuit
Fathers gave the counsel they did in all good faith, as is
quite credible; others that they were traitors and had been
gained over by the King of Spain, to the end they might
so bring about the undoing of the young and gallant King
of Portugal, courageous and fiery as he was, and himself
be the better able to lay his hands on that he did after
seize. Be this as it may, ’tis certain both these disasters
befell through these folk, which be fain to manage armies,
yet have never learned the trade of war.</p>

<p>And this is why the great Duc de Guise, after he had
been sore deceived in his Italian expedition, was often used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
to say, “I do love God’s Church, yet will I never undertake
a conquest on the word and faith of any Priest.” By
this he was for chiding the Pope, Caraffa, known as Paul
IV., which had not kept his promises made to him in the
most impressive and solemn words, or mayhap the Cardinal,
his brother, who had gone all the way to Rome to
discuss the matter and see how the land lay, after which
he did recklessly urge his brother to the enterprise. It
may well be the aforesaid Duc de Guise had in his mind
both Pope and Cardinal; for undoubtedly, as I have been
informed, whenever the Duke did repeat this saying, as oft
he did, before his brother, the latter deeming it a stone
pitched into his garden, would be secretly much enraged
and furiously angry. This is a digression, but my subject
seemed to warrant it.</p>

<p>To return now to our good Queen Mary of Hungary.
After this disaster to her husband, she was left a very
young and beautiful widow, as I have heard many persons
say which have seen her, as also according to the portraits
of her I have seen, which do all represent her as very fair,
giving her never an ugly or censurable feature, except
only her heavy, projecting mouth, or “Austrian
<span class="no-wrap">lip.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103*]</a></span>
However this doth not really come from the House of
Austria, but from that of Burgundy, as I have heard a
lady of the Court at that time relate. She said how once
when Queen Eleanor was passing by way of Dijon on
her way to pay her devotions at the Monastery of the
Chartreuse in that region, and to visit the reverend
sepulchres of her ancestors, the Dukes of Burgundy, she
was curious to have these opened, as many monarchs have
done with theirs. Some of the bodies she did find so
whole and well preserved she did recognise many of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
features, and amongst others the mouth. Whereupon
she did suddenly cry: “Ah! I thought we did take our
mouths from them of Austria; but by what I see here,
we seem rather to get them from Mary of Burgundy,
our ancestress, and the Dukes of Burgundy, our ancestors.
If ever I see the Emperor, my brother, I will tell him;
nay! I will write him at once.” The lady which was then
present told me she did herself hear these words, declaring
further the Queen did pronounce them as if pleased at her
discovery. And in this she was very right, for truly
the House of Burgundy was every whit as good as that
of Austria, springing as it did from a son of France,
Philip le Hardi, from whom they had inherited much
wealth and courage and high spirit. Indeed I imagine
there were never four greater Dukes, one after the other,
than were these four Dukes of Burgundy. Truly I may be
charged with everlastingly wandering from my subject;
but ’tis an easy matter to excuse me, I think, seeing I have
never been taught the art of careful and correct writing.</p>

<p>Our Queen Mary of Hungary then was a most fair and
agreeable Princess, and a very amiable, albeit she did
show herself somewhat over masculine. But for that she
was none the worse for love, nor yet for war, which she did
take for her chiefest exercise. The Emperor, her brother,
seeing her meet for this work and very apt therein, did
send to summon her and beg her to come to him, for to
give her the charge of her aunt Marguerite of Flanders
had held, which was a very wise Princess and one that did
govern his Province of the Low Countries with as much
gentleness as the other had used severity. Wherefore so
long as she lived, King Francis did never direct his arms
toward that quarter, saying he would fain avoid giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
displeasure to so noble a Princess, which did show her
so well disposed to France, and so wise and virtuous to
boot. Unhappy too beyond her deserts in her marriages,
whereof the first was with King Charles VIII., by whom
she was while still quite a girl sent back to her father’s
house; the second with the King of Aragon’s son, John
by name, of whom she had a posthumous son that died
soon after its birth. The third was with the handsome
Duke Philibert of Savoy, of whom she had no offspring,
and for that cause did bear the device, <i>Fortune infortune,
fors une</i>. She doth lie with her husband in the beautiful
and most splendid Cloister of Brou, near the town of
Bourg en Bresse, a Church I have myself visited.</p>

<p>This same Queen of Hungary then did greatly help the
Emperor, seeing how isolated he was. ’Twas true he had
Ferdinand, King of the Romans, his brother; yet was
it all he could do to make head against that great conqueror,
the Sultan Soliman. The Emperor had moreover
on his hands the affairs of Italy, which was at that time
all a-fire; while Germany was little better by reason of
the Grand Turk, and he was harassed to boot with Hungary,
Spain at the time of its rebellion under M. de Chièvres,
the Indies, the Low Countries, Barbary, and France,
which last was the most sore burden of all, in a word with
the business of nigh half the world, in a manner of
<span class="no-wrap">speaking.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104*]</a></span>
He did make his sister Governess General of all the
Netherlands, where by the space of two or three and
twenty years she did him such excellent service I really
cannot tell what he would have done without her. So
he did entrust her with entire charge of the government
of those districts, and even when himself was in Flanders,
did leave all the management of his provinces in that quarter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
in her hands. The council was held under her direction
and in her apartments even when the Emperor was present
and did attend, as I have been told he often did. ’Tis
true she was very able and did manage it all for him,
reporting to him all that had taken place at the meeting
when he was not there, in all which he did find the utmost
pleasure. She did carry out some very successful wars
too, whether by her generals or in person, always riding
a-horse, like a noble-hearted Amazon-queen.</p>

<p>She it was which did first begin those burnings of
strongholds in our land of France, destroying thus some
of the finest houses and castles, and in especial that of
<span class="no-wrap">Folembray,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105*]</a></span>
a beautiful and agreeable residence our Kings
had built them for the delight and pleasure of the chase.
At this the King did feel so sore despite and displeasure
as that no long while after she did get of him as good as
she gave, for he took his revenge on her noble house of
Bains, the which was held for one of the marvels of the
world, shaming so to speak all other beautiful buildings
of the earth, and I have heard those say that had seen
it in its perfection, comparable even to the seven wonders
of the world, so renowned in Antiquity. ’Twas there she
did entertain the Emperor Charles and all his Court,
the time when his son, King Philip, came from Spain to
Flanders for to visit his father, such excellence and perfection
of magnificence being then displayed that naught
else was spoke of at the time save only <i>las fiestas de Bains</i>,
as the Spaniards said. Moreover I do remember on the
journey to Bayonne, when some very splendid shows were
given, tilting at the ring, combats, masquerades and games,
’twas all naught to be compared with these famous <i>fiestas
de Bains</i>,—as sundry old Spanish noblemen which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
witnessed them did declare, and as I have seen myself in
a Work writ in Spanish on purpose to celebrate them.
And it may be certainly said there hath never aught been
done or seen finer, equalling even the splendours of Roman
days, and copying their old-time sports, always excepting
the fights of Gladiators and wild beasts. But with this
only exception, the feasts of Bains were finer, more agreeable,
as well as more varied and general.</p>

<p>These fêtes I would most dearly love to describe here,
according to the particulars I have gleaned from this
Spanish work, as well as learned from sundry eye-witnesses,
and in especial from Madame de Fontaine, surnamed
<span class="no-wrap">Torcy,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106*]</a></span>
acting as sister for the time being to Queen
Eleanor; but I should be blamed as too continually digressing
from my subject. So I must e’en keep it for a
tid-bit some other time, the matter really meriting full
description. Amongst the most splendid of the shows,
I will name but this. She had a great fortress of brick,
which was assaulted, defended, and relieved by a body
of six thousand foot-men of veteran regiments, bombarded
by thirty pieces of ordnance, whether in the trenches or
on the walls, with all identical methods and ceremonies
as in actual war. The siege did last three days and an
half, and so fine a sight was never seen; for assaults were
delivered, relief brought up, the besieged beaten back,
both cavalry and infantry participating in the manœuvres,
under charge of the Prince of Piedmont, the place being
eventually surrendered on terms, in part favourable, in
part rather hard, the garrison being granted their lives
and withdrawing under escort. In a word no detail of
real war was forgot,—all to the singular gratification
of the Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span></p>

<p>Rest assured, if the Queen was lavish on that occasion,
’twas but to show her brother that what he had had of
him, estates, pensions, benefits, share of his conquests, all
was vowed to the further heightening of his glory and
pleasure. Wherefore the said Emperor was greatly pleased
and did highly commend and approve the great expenditure,
and especially that lavished on his own chamber.
This was hung with tapestry of a raised warp, all of gold,
silver and silk, where were figured and represented in their
true colours all the famous conquests, high emprises, warlike
expeditions and battles, he had ever made and won,
above all not forgetting the defeat of Soliman before
Vienna, and the taking prisoner of King Francis I. In
fact there was naught therein that was not of the best and
most highly wrought.</p>

<p>But truly the unfortunate mansion did lose all its splendour
later, forasmuch as it was utterly devastated, pillaged,
ruined and overthrown. I have heard say how its
mistress, on learning this ruin, did fall in such distress,
despite and fury, that ’twas many days ere she could be
appeased. Subsequently, when one day passing near the
spot, she was fain to see the remains, and gazing very
sadly at these, did swear, the tears in her eyes, that all
France should repent the deed and be right sorry for
these conflagrations, and that she would never be content
till yonder proud Castle of Fontainebleau, whereof folk
did make so much, was levelled with the earth and not
one stone left on another. And in very deed she did spew
out her anger right fiercely over the unhappy land of
Picardy, which felt the sore effects of her wrath and the
fires she kindled there; and I ween, if truce had not interfered,
her vengeance would have been startling. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
she was of a proud and hard heart, and slow to be
appeased, and was generally held, of her own people as
well as ours, somewhat over cruel; but such is ever the bent
of women, especially of high-born women, which be very
ready to take vengeance for any offence done them. The
Emperor, by all they say, did only love her the more
for this.</p>

<p>I have heard tell how, when the Emperor did abdicate
at Brussels and strip him of his power, the ceremony being
held in a great Hall wherein he had called together an
assembly of his Estates, after he had made a set speech
and said all he wished to his son, and had likewise humbly
thanked his sister, Queen Mary, which was seated by the
side of the Emperor her brother, the latter presently
rising from her seat, and with a deep reverence to her
brother, did address the people with a grave and dignified
port and much confidence and grace, and said as follows:
“Gentlemen, for these three and twenty years past that
my brother, the Emperor, hath been pleased to grant
me the charge and government of these Low Countries,
I have ever employed in the said task all the means and
abilities that God, Nature and Fortune have bestowed on
me, for to perform the same to the utmost of my powers.
But an if in aught I have made failure, I am surely to
be excused, for I think I have never forgot my duty nor
spared the proper pains. Yet, and if I <i>have</i> lacked in
anything, I do beg you to forgive me. However, if there
be any one of you will not so do, but is ill content with
me and my government, why! ’tis the smallest of my cares,
seeing the Emperor, my brother, is well content, and to
please him, and him alone, hath ever been the chiefest
of my desires and cares.” With these words and another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
deep reverence to the Emperor, she did resume her seat.
I have heard some say this speech was found of many
somewhat over proud and haughty, more especially on
occasion her giving up her charge and bidding farewell
to a people she was about to leave. ’Twould surely have
been more natural, had she desired to leave a good savour
in their mouth and some grief behind her on her departure.
But for all this she had never a thought, seeing her sole
end was to please and content her brother, and from
henceforth to take no heed of the world but keep her
brother company in his retirement and life of prayer.</p>

<p>This account I had of a gentleman of my brother’s
suite, which was at the time at Brussels, whither he had
gone to treat of the ransom of my brother aforesaid, he
having been taken prisoner in Hedin, and having spent five
years in confinement at Lille in Flanders. The said
gentleman was present throughout this assembly and
mournful abdication of the Emperor; and did tell me how
not a few persons were something scandalized in secret
at this haughty pronouncement of the Queen’s, yet did
never dare say a word or let their opinion appear, seeing
plainly they had to do with a masterful dame, which, if
angered, would surely before her final departure have
done something startling for a last stroke.</p>

<p>Presently freed of all her charge and responsibility, she
doth accompany her brother to Spain; which land she
did never after quit, either she or her sister Queen Eleanor,
till the day of death. Of the three, each did survive the
other by one year; the Emperor died first, the Queen of
France next, being the eldest, then the Queen of Hungary
after the two others, her brother and sister. Both sisters
did behave them wisely and well in widowhood; the Queen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
of Hungary was a longer time widow than her sister, and
did never marry again, while her sister did so twice, partly
to be Queen of France, a dainty morsel, partly by the
prayers and persuasion of the Emperor, to the end she
might be a sure pledge of peace and public quietness. Not
that the said pledge did avail for long while, for War
brake out again presently, as cruel as ever. However
this was no fault of the poor Princess, who did all she
could. Yet for all that did King Francis, her husband,
treat her but scurvily, hating and abominating the connection,
as I have been told.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">4.</p>

<p>After the departure of the Queen of Hungary
there was left no great Princess with King
Philip (now Sovereign Lord invested with his
domains in the Netherlands and elsewhere),
but only the Duchesse de Lorraine, Christina of
<span class="no-wrap">Denmark,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107*]</a></span>
his cousin german, later entitled Her Highness,
which did always hold him good company, so long as he
tarried in these parts. She did add much to the brilliance
of his Court, for truly no Court, whether of King, Prince,
Emperor or Monarch, no matter how magnificent it be,
is of much account, if it be not accompanied and seconded
by a Queen’s or Empress’s Court, or at least a great
Princess’s, and thereat a good abundance of noble dames
and damsels, as both myself have observed and have heard
pronouncement to the same effect in the highest quarters.</p>

<p>This said Princess was in mine opinion one of the most
beauteous and most well accomplished Princesses I have
ever seen,—in face very fair and pleasing, her figure very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
tall and fine, her conversation agreeable, and above all her
dress most excellent. In fact all her life she was the pattern
and model of fashion to all the ladies of France.
This mode of dressing head and hair and arranging the
veil was known as the Lorraine way, and ’twas a pretty
sight to see our Court ladies so attired. These were ever
a-making grand fêtes and splendid shows, the better
thereat to show off their dainty adornments, all being <i>à la
Lorraine</i> and copied after Her Highness. In especial she
had one of the prettiest hands ever seen; and I have heard
the Queen Mother herself praise the same, and liken it to
her own for perfection. She had an excellent seat on
horseback, and rode with no little grace, always using the
stirrup attached to the saddle, the mode whereof she had
learned of the Queen Marie, her aunt, and the Queen
Mother, so I have heard say of her; for previously she
had ridden with help of the old-fashioned
<span class="no-wrap">“planchette,”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span>
which was far from properly showing off her grace and
her elegant seat like the stirrup. In all this she was for
imitating the Queen her aunt, never mounting any but
Spanish horses, Turks, Barbs and the very best jennets,
which could go well at the amble. Of such I have seen a
dozen capital mounts at one time in her stable, all so excellent,
’twere impossible to say one was better than another.
The said aunt did love her dearly, as well for the
exercises they both were fond of, hunting, riding and the
like, as for her virtues, the which she did observe in her.
Accordingly, after her marriage, she did often go to visit
her in Flanders, as I have heard Madame de Fontaines
relate; and indeed after she became a widow, and especially
after her son had been taken from her, she did quit
Lorraine altogether in despite, so proud and high of heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
was she. She did thereafter take up her abode with the
Emperor her uncle and the Queens her aunts, all which
great personages did receive her with no small pleasure.</p>

<p>She did bear exceeding hardly the loss and absence of
her son, and this in spite of all possible excuses which
King Henri did make her, and his declared intention of
adopting him as his son. But presently, finding no assuagement,
and seeing how they were giving him one M.
de La Brousse as tutor, instead of the one he now had,
namely M. de Montbardon, a very wise and honourable
gentleman the Emperor himself had assigned to that office,
having long known him for a worthy man, for he
had been in the service of M. de Bourbon, and was a
French refugee, the Princess, thinking all desperate, did
seek out King Henri one Holy Thursday in the great Gallery
at Nancy, where all his Court was assembled. Thus,
with an assured grace and that great beauty which did
make her yet more admirable, she did advance, with no
undue awe or any sort of abasement at his grandeur, albeit
bowing low in reverence before him; and in suppliant
wise, with tears in her eyes, the which did but make her
more fair and more delightsome to look upon, did remonstrate
with the King as to the wrong he was doing her in
taking away her son,—the dearest possession she had in
all the world. Little did she deserve, she added, so harsh
treatment, seeing the high station she was born in and
the fact she had never dreamed of doing aught to his
disservice. All this she said so well and with so excellent
a grace, with reasoning so cogent and complaint so pitiful,
as that the King, always very courteous toward ladies,
was deeply stirred with compassion,—and not he alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
but all the Lords and Princes, great and small, which were
present at the sight.</p>

<p>The King, who was the most respectful monarch toward
ladies hath ever been in France, did answer her in
very honourable terms, albeit with no rigmarole of words
nor by way of set harangue, as Paradin doth represent
the matter in his <i>History of France</i>; for indeed of his
nature this monarch was not so prolix, nor copious in
reasons and fine speeches, nor a mighty orator. Neither
had he any need to be, nor is it becoming that a King
should play the philosopher and rhetorician, the shortest
replies and briefest questions being more meet for him and
more becoming. This I have heard argued by not a few
great men, amongst others by M. de
<span class="no-wrap">Pibrac,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109*]</a></span>
whose judgment
was much to be relied on by reason of the competence
of knowledge he did possess. Moreover any one
that shall read the speech as given by Paradin, as supposed
by him to have been delivered in this place by King
Henri, will credit never a word of it; besides which, I
have heard positively from a number of great folk which
were there present that he did not make any such lengthy
harangue as the historian saith.</p>

<p>’Tis quite true at the same time that he did condole
with her in very honourable and proper phrase on her
alleged grievance, saying she had no real reason to be
troubled thereat, for that ’twas to assure the lad’s estate,
and not out of any selfish hostility toward him, he was
fain to have her son by his side, and to keep him along
with his own son and heir, to share his bringing up and
fashion of life and fortune. Further that himself being
French, and the boy of French extraction, he could scarce
be better off than to be reared at the French Court and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
among French folk, where he had so many kinsmen and
friends. In especial he forgat not to add how the house
of Lorraine did lie under greater obligation to that of
France than to any other in all Christendom, alleging the
countenance given by France to the Duke of Lorraine as
against Duke Charles of Burgundy, that was slain before
Nancy. For that ’twas an undoubted truth to say that
but for that Country’s help, the said Duke would have
utterly undone the Duke of Lorraine and his Duchy to
boot, and made him the most unhappy Prince in the world.
He did further allege the gratitude they of the House of
Lorraine did owe to the French, for the great assistance
rendered them by the latter in their successes in the Holy
Wars and conquests of Jerusalem, and the Kingdom of
Naples and Sicily. Further he did declare how neither his
natural bent nor true interests were like to set him on
ruining and undoing Princes, but rather to help the same
in all ways, when in danger and difficulty,—as he had
actually done to the little Queen of Scots, a near kinswoman
of his son, to the Duke of Parma, as well as to
Germany, that was so sore pressed it was nigh coming to
utter ruin without such help. The same kindness and
generosity, he said, was his motive for taking the young
Prince of Lorraine under his protection, for to bring him
up to an higher estate than else he could aspire to, and
make him his son by marrying him eventually to one of
his own daughters; in fine that she had no sort of call to
be afflicted at his action.</p>

<p>Yet could not all these fine words and excellent reasons
in any wise calm her grief, neither enable her to bear her
loss one whit more patiently. So presently with another
deep reverence, and still shedding many pathetic tears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
she did withdraw her to her own chamber, the King himself
conducting her to the door thereof. Next day, before
quitting the place, he did visit her in her chamber to bid
her farewell, but without her winning any concession as to
her petition. Accordingly having thus seen her beloved
son torn from her and carried away to France, she did
resolve for her part to leave Lorraine altogether and
retire to Flanders to the side of her uncle the Emperor
(oh! the fine sound of that word) and to the company
of her cousin King Philip and the Queens her aunts—a
noble alliance and a great! This she did; and did never
leave Flanders more, till after conclusion of the peace
betwixt the two Kings, when he of Spain took ship and
sailed away for that country.</p>

<p>To the making of the said peace she did no little avail,
my! rather was the chiefest contributor thereto. For
the delegates of the one side and the other, by what I
have heard said, after having laboured and sweated all
in vain at Cercan for several days, without arranging or
settling aught, were still at fault and off the scent, as we
say in hunting, when she, whether inspired by wisdom
from on high or urged thereto by Christian zeal and her
own kind heart, did take up the chase, and carry this important
negotiation to a good end and one so fortunate
to all Christian peoples. And of a truth ’twas said no
other could have been found so meet to move and set in
place this great corner stone, seeing she was a lady of
skill and experience if ever there was one, as well as of
high and weighty authority,—and there can be never a
doubt but petty, low-born folk are not so apt for the
like business as great personages be. For this and many
other reasons the King her cousin did feel much trust and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
confidence in her, well knowing her good qualities. He
did ever love her well, bearing her much affection and esteem;
and indeed she did help him much and contribute
greatly to the splendour and renown of his Court, the
which without her would have sorely lacked brilliancy.
Yet afterward, I have been told, he did show her but poor
gratitude and treated her scurvily with regard to her
lands which did fall to her for jointure in the Duchy of
Milan, where she had been married in first wedlock with
the Duke Sforza; for by what I have been informed, he
did rob her and bring her short of some portion of these.</p>

<p>I have heard it said that after the loss of her son, she
did remain very ill content with the Duc de Guise and the
great Cardinal her brother, holding them to blame for
having advised the King to that course, by reason of their
ambition, both because they were fain to see their near
cousin adopted as son and married within the House of
France, and because she had some while before refused
M. de Guise in marriage, which had sent to her to make
such offer. She being one of the proudest of womankind,
made answer she would never wed the younger son of the
house whereof she had been wife of the eldest. For this
rebuff the Duke did ever after bear her a grudge, and
this although he did lose naught in his subsequent marriage,
his wife being of a most illustrious house and granddaughter
of a King, Louis XII., one of the best and
bravest monarchs have ever sat on the French throne,—and
what is more, being one of the most beautiful women
in Christendom.</p>

<p>Hereanent I have heard tell how the first time these two
beauteous Princesses met, both were so curious to mark
one the other, whether directing their gaze straight in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
the face, or askance or sideways, as that neither could
look long enough, so set were they and eager to examine
each other’s charms. I leave you to fancy all the divers
thoughts must have traversed these fair ladies’ minds.
Just so we do read how a little before the great battle
was fought in Africa betwixt Scipio and Hannibal, which
did put a final end to the War of Rome and Carthage,
how previous to its beginning, they did come together in a
short truce of some two hours’ duration. Whenas they
were approached near each other, there the twain of
them stood some little while wrapped in contemplation
one of the other, each thinking of the valour of the other,
so renowned by their exploits and so well represented in
their gallant visages, their persons, and their fine, warlike
ways and bearing. Then after so tarrying entranced in
these noble dreams the one of the other, they did presently
set them to negotiation after the fashion Livy hath
so well described. Thus valour doth make itself esteemed
in the midst of enmity and hate, as doth beauty in the
midst of mutual jealousy,—as proven in the case of the
two fair Princesses I have spoke of.</p>

<p>Truly the beauty and charming grace of these twain
might well be pronounced equal, only that Madame de
Guise mayhap did in some ways bear the bell. But she was
well content to surpass her rival in these qualities only,
never a whit in pride and high bearing; for indeed she
was the most gentle, good, condescending and affable
Princess ever known, albeit she could show herself at need
high-spirited and gallant. Nature had framed her so,
no less by reason of her tall and noble figure than of her
dignified port and stately carriage, so that to look at
her a man might well fear and think twice about addressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
her in speech, yet having plucked up courage so to
accost her, naught would he find in her but all sweetness,
candour and good-nature,—these pleasant qualities being
inherited from her grandfather, the good father of his
people, and the kindly French habit. ’Tis true enough
however she knew very well how to keep her dignity and
show her pride, when need was. I do hope to further
speak of her specially in another place.</p>

<p>Her Highness of Lorraine on the contrary was exceeding
proud and somewhat overweening. This myself did
note on sundry occasions in her bearing toward the Queen
of Scots, who after she was a widow, did make a journey
to Lorraine, where I then was. Not seldom you would
have thought the aforesaid proud Princess was eager to
take advantage and encroach somewhat upon the unhappy
Queen’s majesty. Yet the latter, who was a woman of
the world and of a high spirit, did never give her occasion
to glory over her or in any wise encroach on her dignity,
albeit her bearing was always gentleness itself. Indeed the
Cardinal her brother had duly warned her and given her
an inkling of the haughty humour of the said Princess.</p>

<p>Never could this latter entirely rid her of her pride,
yet was she fain to modify the same somewhat toward the
Queen Mother (Catherine de Medici), when they met.
Verily ’twas pride against pride; for the Queen Mother
was the very proudest woman in all the world, when need
was, as I have myself seen, and heard the same character
given her of many great personages,—and above all if
it were necessary to lower the pride of some presumptuous
person, for she would ever contrive to abase such to the
very bowels of the earth. Yet did she always bear herself
courteously toward her Highness, treating her with sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
deference and respect, yet ever keeping a tight
rein, hand high or hand low as occasion did demand, for
fear she should mayhap forget herself and presume on
some liberty; and myself did hear her twice or thrice declare,
“Yonder is the proudest woman I ever saw!” This
was at the time she came to the coronation of our late
King Charles IX. at Reims, whither she was invited. On
her entry into that city, she would not ride a-horseback,
fearing thereby to derogate something of her dignity and
rank, but did arrive in a coach magnificently furnished,
all covered with black velvet, by reason of her widowhood,
and drawn by four white barbs, the finest could anywhere
be chosen, harnessed four abreast, as it had been a triumphal
chariot. Herself was at the carriage door,
splendidly attired, though all in black, in a velvet robe,
but her head dress all of white, magnificently arranged
and set off. At the other door was one of her daughters,
which was after Duchess of
<span class="no-wrap">Bavaria;<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110*]</a></span>
and within, her
maid of honour, the Princess of Macedonia. The Queen
Mother, desiring to see her enter the outer court in this
triumphant guise, did set her at a window, exclaiming in
an undertone, “Oh! the haughty dame it is!” Presently
when she had stepped down from her carriage and
mounted to the great hall above, the Queen did go forward
to meet her only so far as the midmost of the hall,
or mayhap a little farther and somewhat nearer the entrance
door than the upper end. Yet did she receive her
very graciously, and showed her great honour; for at the
time she was ruler in all things, in view of the youth of
the King her son, and did govern him and make him
entirely conform to her good pleasure. All the Court,
great and small alike, did esteem and much admire the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
said Princess, and much appreciate her beauty, albeit she
was coming nigh the decline of her years, which might
then be something over forty; yet was no sign of change
or decay in her, her Autumn altogether surpassing other
women’s Summer. None can do other than think highly
of this fair Princess, seeing how beautiful she was, and
yet did safeguard her widowhood to the tomb, and so inviolably
and chastely, indulging in no third marriage,
keep her faith to the manes of her husband.</p>

<p>She did die within a year after hearing the news of her
being Queen of Denmark, whence she did spring, and the
Kingdom of which had fallen to her. In this wise before
her death she did see her title of Highness, the which she
had borne so long, changed to that of Majesty, which yet
was hers but a short while, less than six months in all. I
ween she would gladly enough have borne the old title
still, an if she could have kept therewith her erstwhile
bloom of youth and beauty, for truly all empires and
kingdoms be as nothing compared with youth. Natheless
was it an honour and consolation to her before her death
to bear this name of Queen; but for all this, by what I
have heard say, she was firm resolved not to go to her
kingdom, but to finish out the rest of her days on her
jointure lands in Italy, at Tortona. And the folk of
that country did call her naught else but the Lady of
Tortona—not a very grand title and quite unworthy of
her. Thither she had retired a good while before her
decease, as well for sake of certain vows she had sworn to
perform at the holy places of that region, as to be nearer
the baths of those parts; for she had fallen into bad health
and grown exceeding gouty.</p>

<p>Her life was spent in very pious, holy and honourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
exercises,—praying God and giving much alms and charity
toward the poor, and above all toward widows, among
whom she did not forget the unfortunate Madame Castellane
of Milan, the which we have seen at Court dragging
out a miserable existence, had it not been for the help of
the Queen Mother, which did always provide her somewhat
to live on. She was daughter of the Princess of Macedonia,
being a scion of that great house. Myself have
seen her a venerable and aged dame; and she had been
governess to her Highness. The latter, learning the extreme
poverty wherein the poor lady did live, sent to seek
her out, and had her brought to her side and did treat her
so well she never more felt the sore distress she had endured
in France.</p>

<p>Such is the summary account I have been able to give
of this great and noble Princess, and how, a widow and a
very beautiful woman, she lived a most wise and prudent
life. True, it may be said she was married previously to
the Duke Sforza. Well and good! but he did die immediately
after, and they were married less than a year, and
she was made a widow at fifteen or sixteen. Whereupon
her uncle the Emperor did wed her to the Duke of Lorraine,
the better to strengthen himself in his divers alliances.
But once again she was widowed in the flower of
her age, having enjoyed her fine marriage but a very few
years. The days which were left her, the best of her life
and those most highly to be valued and most delightfully
to be enjoyed, these she did deliberately spend in a retired
and chaste widowhood.</p>

<p>Well! seeing I am on the subject, I must e’en speak of
some other fair widows in briefest phrase,—and first of
one of former days, that noble widow, Blanche de
<span class="no-wrap">Montferrat,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111*]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
one of the great and ancient houses of Italy, which
was Duchess of Savoy and the most beauteous and most
perfect Princess of her time, and one of the most prudent
and well advised. So well and wisely did she govern her
son’s minority and his lands, that never was seen so prudent
a dame and so excellent a mother, left a widow as
she was at three and twenty.</p>

<p>She it was which did receive so honourably the young
King Charles VIII., on his way to his Kingdom of Naples,
in all her lands, and above all in her good town of Turin,
where she did afford him a very stately entry. Herself
was pleased to be present, and did walk in the progress
very sumptuously attired, showing she well understood
her dignity as a great lady; for she was in imposing array,
clad in a long robe of cloth of gold fretted, and all
bordered with great diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds,
and other rich jewels. Her head likewise was encircled
with the like precious stones, while at her neck she
wore a necklace or collar of huge Oriental pearls of priceless
worth, and on her arms bracelets of the same. She
was mounted on a fine white hackney, very magnificently
caparisoned and led by six tall lackeys, dressed in figured
cloth of gold. Following her came a large company
of damsels, very richly, neatly and charmingly dressed
in the Piedmontese fashion, that ’twas a pleasure to see
them, and after these a very strong body of gentlemen
and knights of the country. Then after her train did
enter and march into the city King Charles himself under
a rich canopy of state, lighting down at length at the
Castle, where he was lodged. There at the Gate, before
entering in, the Duchess of Savoy did present her son to
him, which was yet a mere boy; after which she did make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
him a very excellent speech of welcome, putting at his
service all her lands and goods, both her own and those
of her son. This courtesy the King did accept with gratitude,
thanking her heartily and expressing great obligation
to her. Through all the city were to be seen the
scutcheons of France and of Savoy, bound together with
a true lovers’ knot, uniting the two scutcheons and the
two blazons, with these words, <i>Sanguinis arctus amor</i>
(Close the tie of blood), as described in the <i>Chronicle of</i>
<span class="no-wrap"><i>Savoy</i>.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112*]</a></span></p>

<p>I have heard sundry of our fathers and mothers, which
had it of their own parents as eye-witnesses, and in especial
of the noble lady, the Séneschale de Poitou, my grandmother,
who was then a maid of honour at the Court, declare
how in those days naught else was talked of but the
beauty, wisdom and prudence of this same Princess, and
how all the Courtiers and gallants of the King’s suite,
when they were returned back to France from their journey
thither, were forever discoursing of her and entertaining
the dames and damsels of the Court with praises
of her beauty and virtue, and the King more than any,
which did show every sign of being smit to the heart with
love for so beautiful a lady.</p>

<p>Yet apart from her beauty altogether, he had much
occasion to love her well; for she did help him by every
means she could, and did even strip her of all her precious
stones, pearls and jewelry, to lend them him to raise
money on in whatsoever way seemed good to him. This
was indeed a great obligation and sacrifice, seeing what
great attachment women do always have for their precious
stones, rings and jewelry, so as they would almost rather
lend and put in pawn some precious part of their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
body than their wealth of such things; I mean some
would, though not of course all. At any rate the kindness
done was a very great one; for but for this generosity,
and likewise that of the Marquise de Montferrat,
another very noble and very fair lady, he would have
come to downright shame in no long time, and must have
returned from his expedition before it was half done,
having undertaken the same without money. Herein he
was in the like sorry case with a certain French Bishop
that went to the Council of Trent without money and
without Latin. Verily a putting to sea without biscuit!
Yet is there a difference ’twixt the two; for what the one
did was of his fine, high spirit and noble ambition, the
which did close his eyes to all inconveniences, finding
naught impossible to a brave heart, whereas the other
was in lack both of mother wit and proper experience,
offending out of sheer ignorance and stupidity, unless indeed
it were that he hoped to send round the bag when
he got to his destination.</p>

<p>In the description given of this magnificent entry I
have spoke of just above, is to be noted the splendour of
the attire and adornments of this same Princess, which
were more in accord (some will say) with what is becoming
a wife than a widow. On this the ladies did say at
the time that, to welcome so great a King, she might well
be excused so far, albeit he did hardly claim so great
expenditure; and further that great folk, men and women,
be a law to themselves, and that in those days widows,
so they said, were not so straightlaced and exact in their
dress as they have been for the last forty years. The
fact is a certain great lady I wot of, being in high favour
with a King, indeed his mistress, did dress her somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
in more quiet and modest garb than most, yet always in
silk, to the end she might the better conceal and hide
her game; wherefore the widows then at Court, being fain
to imitate her, did adopt the same fashion. Natheless
was she by no means so strict with herself, nor so stern
in her moderation, but that she dressed both prettily and
richly, only all in black and white, displaying more worldliness
therein than did exactly accord with strict widow’s
weeds, and in especial ever making a point of showing her
beautiful bosom.</p>

<p>Myself did hear the Queen, mother of King Henri III.,
on occasion of the coronation and marriage of that monarch,
say the same: how that widows in days gone by had
not the same carefulness as to their attire, modest bearing
and strict life, as nowadays. She had seen this in the
time of King Francis, who did love an easy-going Court
in all respects. Widows did even dance thereat, and were
taken as partners as readily as maids or wives. In fact
she did once command and beg M. de
<span class="no-wrap">Vaudemont,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113*]</a></span>
by way
of honouring the occasion, to lead out the Dowager Princess
of Condé to the dance. This he did, and danced a
full round with her, as they which were present for the
coronation, as I was myself, did see and well remember.
Such the freedom widows did then enjoy. Nowadays all
this is forbid them as if ’twere a sacrilege, as also the
wearing of colours, for none now dare wear aught but
black and white; though as for underskirts and petticoats,
these as well as their stockings, may be grey, drab, violet
or blue. Some indeed I have seen which have so far indulged
them as to adopt red, scarlet and chamois-yellow,
as in former days; for they could then wear any colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
for bodices and stockings, though not for robes, by what
I am told.</p>

<p>Moreover this same Duchess we have been speaking of
might well enough wear such a robe of cloth of gold, seeing
’twas her proper ducal habit and state costume, and
therefore becoming and lawful, for to display the sovranty
and high dignity of her exalted rank. And this
is even now done by our Countesses and Duchesses, the
which can and do wear the robes belonging to their several
orders on state occasions. Only our widows of to-day
dare under no circumstances wear jewelry, except
only in rings, and on mirrors and <i>Books of Hours</i> and the
like, and set in handsome belts, but not on neck or arms,
or even any great display of pearls in necklaces and
bracelets. Yet I do declare solemnly I have seen widows
as becomingly attired in their white and black, and every
whit as attractively, as some of our tawdrily dressed wives
and maids.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">5.</p>

<p>However enough said concerning this foreign
Princess. ’Tis time to say somewhat of our
French Princesses, and I would wish first to
deal with our fair and unsullied Queen, Louise de
<span class="no-wrap">Lorraine,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114*]</a></span>
wife of King Henri III., late deceased. This
Princess can and ought to be commended on many
grounds. In her marriage she did bear her towards the
King her husband so wisely, modestly and loyally, as that
the knot wherewith she was bound in wedlock with him
did always remain so firm and indissoluble, no breaking
or slackness of the same was ever found, and this although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
the King did sometimes wander elsewhither to satisfy his
passions, as great folks will, the which have a special
freedom accorded them. Beside this, quite at the very
beginning of their married life, in fact within ten days
of their union, he did give her no slight cause for displeasure,
for that he did deprive her of her women of the
chamber and maids of honour, which had ever been with
her and in her service, when still a girl, whereat she was
exceeding sorry. ’Twas a heavy blow to her affection, in
especial for Mlle. de Changy, a very fair and most honourable
damsel, and one little deserving to be banished the
company of her mistress and expelled the Court. Indeed
’tis ever a sore despite to lose a trusty companion and
confidante. I have heard how one day a lady, one of her
most privy friends, was presuming enough to chide her
and urge, by way of jest and half-serious flaunt, that,
seeing she could never have children by the King, for
many reasons then commonly alleged, she would do well
to borrow secret aid of some third person, for to have
offspring, to the end she might not be left without authority,
supposing her husband did chance to die, but might
some day very like be Queen Mother of a King of France,
and hold the same rank and high estate as the Queen
mother-in-law. But the lady did long regret her counsel,
semi-burlesque as it was; for the Queen took the same
exceeding ill, and did never after like her worthy adviser,
preferring to base her dignity on her chastity and virtuous
life rather than on a lineage sprung of evil-doing.
Still the advice, in a worldly point of view and according
to Machiavelli’s doctrine, was not to be despised.</p>

<p>Very different was the behaviour, so ’tis said, of Queen
Mary of England, third wife of King Louis XII. Being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
but ill-content and distrustful of the feebleness of the
King her husband, she was fain to sound these waters for
herself, taking for guide in crossing the ford the noble
Comte d’Angoulême, the same which was afterward King
Francis, then a young, handsome and charming Prince,
to whom she did show much favour, always addressing
him as “My excellent son-in-law;” as indeed he was, having
already married Madame Claude, daughter of King
Louis. The fact is she was smit with love for him; and
he on seeing her was in much the same case. The end
was the pair were very nigh coming together, the which
they would surely have done but for the late M. de
<span class="no-wrap">Grignaux,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115*]</a></span>
a nobleman of honour and good birth from Périgord,
a prudent and well advised man, who had been
gentleman in waiting to the Queen Anne, as we have above
said, and was so still to Queen Mary. He seeing the play
was very like to come off, did chide the aforesaid Comte
d’Angoulême for the fault he was about to commit, saying
with an angry energy: “Nay! by the Risen God (this
was his favourite oath), what would you be at? See you
not this woman, keen and cunning as she is, is fain to draw
you to her, to the end you may get her with child? But
an if she come to have a son, what of you? You are still
plain Comte d’Angoulême, and never King of France, as
you do hope to be. The King her husband is old, and
cannot now make her children. You must needs meddle
and go with her, you with your young hot blood, and she
the same, and by the Risen Lord! the end will be she will
just catch on like a limed bird, conceive you a child, and
there you are! After that you’ve only to say, ‘Goodbye!
my chance of the fair Kingdom of France!’ Wherefore
I say, reflect.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span></p>

<p>In fact the said Queen was for practising and proving
true the Spanish saw or proverb, which saith, <i>munca muger
aguda murio sin herederos</i>, “no clever woman ever
died without heirs;” or in other words, an if her husband
make her none, she will call in other help to get her
end. Now M. d’Angoulême <i>did</i> reflect and sware he was
going to be wise and refrain; yet tried and tempted again
and again with the wiles and advances of the fair Englishwoman,
did presently throw him more fiercely than
ever into the pursuit of her. Such the effects of love and
passion! such the power of a mere bit of flesh and blood,
that for its sake men will surrender kingdoms and empires,
and altogether lose the same, as we find over and over
again in History. Eventually M. de Grignaux, seeing the
young man was bent on his own undoing and the carrying
further of his amour, told Madame d’Angoulême, his
mother, of the matter, which did so reprove and smartly
chide him, as that he gave up the sport once and for all.</p>

<p>None the less ’tis said the Queen did all she could to
live and reign as Queen Mother for some little while before
and after the death of the King her husband. However
she lost him too soon, and had no sufficient time to carry
through her purpose. Yet even so, she did spread the
report, after the King’s death, that she was pregnant.
Accordingly, albeit naught really inside her belly, ’tis said
she would swell out the outside thereof by means of linen
wrappages gradually more and more every day, and that
when her full time was come, she did propose to have
ready a supposititious child of another woman, and produce
this at the instant of her pretended delivery. But
the Queen Regent, which was from Savoy and knew somewhat
about child-bearing and the like, seeing things were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
going somewhat too fast for her and her son, had her so
well watched and examined of physicians and midwives,
that her wrappages and clouts being noted, she was found
out and baulked in her design, and instead of being Queen
Mother was incontinently sent back to her own country.</p>

<p>See the difference betwixt this Princess Mary and our
good Queen Louise, which was so wise, chaste and virtuous,
she did never desire, whether by true or false pretence,
to be Queen Mother. But an if she had wished to
play the like game as other, there would have been little
difficulty, for there was none to watch her with any care,—and
’twould have sore surprised not a few. And for
her behaviour our present King doth owe her much
thanks, and should love and honour her greatly; for an
if she had played this game, and had brought forward an
infant, her own or another’s, the King instead of being
what he is, would have been but a Regent of France, mayhap
not even that. And this feeble title would ill have
guarded him from many more wars and troubles than he
hath actually had.</p>

<p>I have heard some, both men of religion and of the
world, hold and maintain this opinion: that our Queen
would have done better to have played this part, and that
in that case France would never have endured so much
wretchedness, poverty and ruin as she hath now, and is
like to have, and the True Faith better supported into
the bargain. As to this I can but refer me to those gallant
and curious questioners which do debate these points
(but myself do believe never a word of it, for we be all
right well satisfied with our King, God save him!) for
them to pronounce judgment thereon; for they have a
fine subject, and one admitting wide discussion as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
State’s best interests, though not as to God’s, as seemeth
me. To Him our Queen hath always been deeply devoted,
loving and adoring Him so well, that to serve Him, she
would e’en forget herself and her high estate. For being
a very beauteous Princess (the King indeed did choose her
for her beauty and high virtues), and young, tender and
most charming, she did give up herself to naught else but
only to serve God, do her devotions, visit constantly the
hospitals, heal the sick and bury the dead, forgetting nor
omitting any of the good and holy works which in this
province the holy devout and righteous ladies, Princesses
and Queens of days of yore, did practise in the early
Church. After the death of her husband, she did ever
lead the same life, spending her time in weeping and
mourning for him, beseeching God for his soul; and in
fact her life as a widow was of the same holy character
as her married life had been.</p>

<p>’Tis true she was supposed, during her husband’s lifetime,
to have leaned somewhat to the side of the party of
the <i>Union</i>, because, being so good a Christian and Catholic
as she was, she did naturally prefer them which were
fighting and contending for her Faith and Religion; yet
did she never more favour them, but quitted their faction
altogether, after their assassination of her husband,
though claiming no other vengeance of punishment as a
right but what it should please God to inflict, not that
she did not duly petition men, and above all our King,
with whom lieth the performing of justice for this monstrous
deed of a man of
<span class="no-wrap">religion.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span>
Thus both an married
life and widowhood, did this excellent Princess live blameless.
Eventually she died in the enjoyment of a most
noble and worthy repute, having long languished in sickness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
and grown hectic and parched,—’twas said owing to
her overmuch indulgence in sorrow. She made a very excellent
and pious end. Just before her death, she had her
crown placed at the head of her bed close beside her, and
would never have it removed from there so long as she
yet lived, directing that after her death she should be
crowned and so remain till her body was laid beneath the
ground.</p>

<p>She did leave behind her a sister, Madame de
<span class="no-wrap">Joyeuse,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117*]</a></span>
which was her counterpart in her chaste and modest life,
and did make great mourning and lamentation for her
husband; and verily he was a brave, valiant and well accomplished
Lord. Beside, I have heard say, how when
our present King was in such straits, and shut up and
imprisoned as in a bag in Dieppe, which the Duc du
Maine held invested with forty thousand men, that an if
she had been in the place of the Commander of the town
De Chastes, she would have had revenge of the death of
her husband in a very different fashion from the said
worthy Commander, who for the obligations he lay under
to M. de Joyeuse, ought never to have surrendered, in her
opinion. Nor did she ever like the man afterward, but
did hate him worse than the plague, being unable to excuse
a fault as he had committed, albeit others deem him
to have kept faith and loyalty according to his promises.
But then an angry woman, be the original cause of offence
just or unjust, will take no satisfaction; and this was the
way with this Princess, who could never bring herself to
like our reigning monarch, though she did sore regret the
late King and wore mourning for him, and this although
she did belong to the <i>League</i>; for she always declared both
her husband and she did lie under many obligations to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
him. In fine, she is a good and a wise Princess, and one
that is honoured by the grief and respect she did show to
the ashes of her husband,—for some while that is, for
eventually she did marry again with M. de Luxembourg.
So young as she was, was she to consume away in vain
regrets forever?</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">6.</p>

<p>The Duchesse de Guise, Catherine of Clèves,
one of the three daughters of the house of
Nevers (all three Princesses that can surely
never be enough commended, no less for their
beauty than for their virtue and on whom I have writ a
separate chapter in another place), hath celebrated and
doth celebrate all her days in right worthy fashion the
irreparable loss of her noble husband; but indeed what a
husband was he! He was truly the nonpareil of the world,
and this and no less she did call him in sundry of her letters,
the which she writ to some of her most familiar
friends and lady companions, which myself also did see
after her bereavement, showing them plainly therein by
the sad and mournful words she used with what sore regrets
her soul was wounded.</p>

<p>Her noble sister-in-law, Madame de
<span class="no-wrap">Montpensier,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118*]</a></span>
of whom I do hope to speak further elsewhere, did also bewail
her husband bitterly. Albeit she did lose him when
still very young, and beautiful and charming for many
perfections both of mind and body, she did never think
of marrying again,—and this although she had wedded
him when a mere child in years, and he might have been
her grandfather, so that she had tasted but sparely with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
him of the fruits of wedlock. Yet would she never consent
to indulge a second taste of the same and make up her
defect and arrears in that kind by another marriage.</p>

<p>I have heard not a few noblemen, gentlemen and great
ladies oftentimes express their wonder that the Princesse
de Condé, the Dowager Princess I mean, of the house of
Longueville, did always refuse to marry again, seeing
how she was one of the most beautiful ladies in all France,
and one of the most desirable. But she did remain satisfied
with her condition of widowhood, and would never take
a second husband, and this though left a widow very
young.</p>

<p>The Marquise de Rothelin, her mother, did the like, who
beautiful woman as she was, died a widow. Verily mother
and daughter both might well have set afire a whole kingdom
with their lovely eyes and sweet looks, the which were
renowned at Court and through France for the most
charming and alluring ever seen. And doubtless they did
fire many hearts; yet never a word was ever to be spoke
of love or marriage, both having loyally kept the faith
once pledged to their dead husbands, and never married
again.</p>

<p>I should never have done if I were to name all the Princesses
of our Kings’ Courts in similar case. I must e’en
defer their panegyric to another place. So I will leave
them now, and say somewhat of sundry other ladies,
which though no Princesses, be yet of as illustrious race
and generous heart as they.</p>

<p>Fulvia Mirandola, Madame de Randan, of the noble
house of Admirande, did remain unwed, though left a
widow in the flower of her age and her exquisite beauty.
So great mourning did she make over her loss, that never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
more would she deign to look at herself in her mirror, but
refused the sight of her lovely face to the pellucid crystal
that was so fain to see the same. Her act though not her
words were like those of an ancient dame, which breaking
her mirror and dedicating the fragments to Venus, spake
these words to the Goddess:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">Dico tibi Veneri speculum, quai cernere talem</div>
      <div class="verse indent4">Qualis sum nolo, qualis eram nequeo.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(To thee, Venus, I do dedicate my mirror, for such as I am
now, I care not to see myself, and such as I was, I cannot
more.)</p>
</div>

<p>Not that Madame de Randan did scorn her mirror for
this reason, for indeed she was very beautiful, but by
reason of a vow she had made to her husband’s shade, who
was one of the best and noblest gentlemen of all France.
For his sake she did altogether leave the world and its
vanities, dressing her always very soberly. She wore a
veil habitually, never showing her hair; yet spite of careless
head-dress and her neglect of appearances, her great
beauty was none the less manifest. The late M. de Guise,
late deceased, was used always to call her naught but <i>the
nun</i>; for she was attired and put on like a religious. This
he would say by way of jest and merriment with her; for
he did admire and honour her greatly, seeing how well
affectioned and attached she was to his service and all his
house.</p>

<p>Madame de Carnavalet, twice a widow, did refuse to wed
for the third time with M. d’Espernon, then known as M.
de la Valette the younger, and at the commencement of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
high favour at Court. So deep was he in love with her,
that unable to get of her what he would so fain have had,
for truly she was a very lovely widow and very charming,
he did follow her up persistently and press her sore to
marry him, inducing the King three or four times over to
speak to her in his favour. Yet would she never put herself
again under a husband’s yoke. She had been married
twice, her first husband being the Comte de Montravel,
the second M. de Carnavalet. And when her most privy
friends, myself first and foremost, who was much her admirer,
did chide her for her fault she was committing in
refusing so high a match, one that would place her in
the very midmost and focus of greatness, wealth, riches,
favour and every dignity, seeing how M. de la Valette was
chiefest favourite of the King, and deemed of him only
second to himself, she would answer: that her delight lay
not at all in these things, but in her own free-will and the
perfect liberty and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Madame de Bourdeille, sprung of the illustrious and
ancient house of Montbron and of the Counts of Périgord
and Viscounts of Aunay, being left a widow at the age of
seven or eight and thirty, a very beautiful woman (and I
do think that in all Guienne, of which province she was,
was never another that in her day did surpass her in
beauty, charm and good looks, for indeed she had one of
the finest, tallest and most gracious figures could anywhere
be seen, and if the body was fair the mind was to
match), being so desirable and now widowed, was wooed
and sought after in marriage by three great and wealthy
Lords. To them all she made reply as follows: “I will
not say, as many dames do, that they will never, never
marry again, adding such asseverations you can in no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
wise doubt their firm intention. But I am ready to declare
that, unless God and my carnal being give me not
very different desire to what I feel at this present, and
change me utterly, I have very surely said farewell forever
to matrimony.” Then when another did further object:
“Nay! Madam, but would you wish to burn away
in the flower of your age?” she added: “I wot not what
you mean by burning away; but I do assure you that up
to the present hour, it hath never yet been possible for
me to warm me even, all alone in my bed which is widowed
and cold as ice. Yet in the company of a second husband,
I say not but that, coming nigh his fire, I might
not mayhap burn as you say. But forasmuch as cold is
more easy to endure than heat, I am resolved to continue
in my present condition, and abstain from a second marriage.”
And this resolve she did so express, she hath
kept to this day, having remained a widow twelve years,
without losing aught of her beauty, ever maintaining and
holding sacred one fixed determination. This is truly a
great obligation to her husband’s ashes, and a testimony
how well she loved him, as well as an exceeding binding
claim on her children to honour her memory forever, seeing
how she did end her days a widow.</p>

<p>The late M. d’Estrozze was one of the aspirants to her
hand, and had had his wishes conveyed to her. But great,
noble and allied with the Queen Mother as he was, she did
refuse the match, excusing herself in seemly terms. Yet
what a strange humour, after all, to be beautiful, honourable
and a very rich heiress, and finish out one’s days over
a pen or a solitary seam, lone and cold as ice, and spend
so many widowed nights! Oh! how many dames there be
of a very different complexion,—though not a few also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
of the like! But an if I were for citing all these, I
should never have ended; and especially if I should include
among our Christian ladies those of pagan times.
Of these was that right fair, and good and gentle Roman
lady of yore, Martia, second daughter of Cato of Utica,
sister to Portia, who after losing her husband incessantly
bewailing the said loss, being asked when would be the last
day of her mourning, did make answer ’twould be only
when the last day of her life should come. Moreover being
both very beautiful and very rich, she was more than
once asked when she would marry again, to which she replied:
“’Twill be when I can find a man that will marry
me rather for my merits than for my wealth.” And God
knoweth she was both rich and beautiful, and no less virtuous,
than either, nay! far more so; else had she not
been Cato’s daughter nor Portia’s sister. Yet did she
pass this rebuff on her lovers and suitors, and would
have it they did seek her for her wealth and not for her
merits and virtues, albeit she was as well furnished with
these as any. Thus did she readily rid her of these importunate
gallants.</p>

<p>Saint Jerome in a letter he wrote to one Principia, a
virgin, doth celebrate the praises of a gentle Roman lady
of his time, which was named Marcella, of a good and
noble house, and sprung from a countless line of consuls,
pro-consuls, Praetors, and one that had been left a
widow very young. She was much sought after, both for
her youth and for the antiquity of her house, as well as
for her lovely figure, the which did singularly entrance
the will of men (so saith Saint Jerome, using these very
words; note his observation), and her seemly mien and
virtuous character. Among other suitors was a rich and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
high-born Roman Lord, likewise of Consular rank, and
by name Cerealis, which did eagerly seek to persuade her
to give him her hand in second marriage. Being something
far stricken in years, he did promise her great
wealth and superb gifts as chiefest advantage in the
match. Above all her mother, Albina by name, did
strongly urge her to the marriage, thinking it an excellent
offer and one not lightly to be refused. But she
made answer: “An if I had any wish to throw myself in
the water and entangle me in the bonds of a second marriage,
and not rather vow me to a second chastity, yet
would I fain prefer to get me an husband rather an inheritance.”
Then, the lover deeming she had said this
with an eye to his advanced age, he made reply: that old
folk might very well live long, and young ones die early.
But she retorted: “True, the young may die early, but an
old man cannot live long.” At which word he did take
umbrage, and so left her. I find this fair lady’s saying
admirable and her resolve most commendable.</p>

<p>Not less so was that of Martia, named above, whose
behaviour was not so open to reproof as that of her
sister Portia. For the latter, after the death of her
husband, did determine to live no longer, but kill herself.
Then all instruments of iron being removed, wherewith
she might have taken her life, she did swallow live coals,
and so burned all her inwards, declaring that for a brave
woman means can never be lacking whereby to contrive
her death. This hath been well told by Martial in one
of his Epigrams, writ expressly on this lady’s fate, and
a fine poem it is. Yet did she not, according to certain
philosophers, and in especial Aristotle in his Ethics,
(speaking of courage or fortitude) show herein any high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
degree of courage or magnanimity in killing herself, as
many others have done, and her own husband; for that,
to avoid a greater ill, they do throw themselves upon the
less. On this point I have writ a discourse elsewhere.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, ’twould surely have been better, had
this same Portia rather devoted her days to mourning her
husband and avenging his death than in contriving her
own. For this did serve no good end whatsoever, except
mayhap a gratification of her own pique, as I have heard
some women say in blame of her action. Natheless for
myself, I cannot enough commend her, and all other
widows, which do show their love for their dead husbands
as lively as in their lifetime. And this is why Saint Paul
hath so highly praised and commended them, holding this
doctrine of his great Master. Yet have I been taught
of some of the most clear sighted and most eloquent persons
I know, that beautiful young widows which do
remain in that condition in the very flower of their sweet
age and heyday of their life, do exercise an over great
cruelty upon themselves and nature, so to conspire
against their own selves, and refuse to taste again the
gentle joys of a second marriage. This much doth divine
law no less than human allow them, as well as nature,
youth and beauty; yet must they needs abstain in obedience
to some vow and obstinate resolve, the which they
have fantastically determined in their silly heads to keep
to the vain and empty simulacra of their husbands, that
standing like sentinels forgot in the other world, and
dwelling yonder in the Elysian fields, be either altogether
careless of them and their doings or mayhap do but
deride the same. On this question generally all such dames
should refer them to the eloquent remonstrances and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
excellent arguments the which Anna doth bring forward
to her sister Dido, in the Fourth Book of the Aeneid.
These be most excellent for to teach a fair young widow
not over sternly to swear a vow of never altering her
condition, rather out of bigotry than real religion. An
if after their husbands’ death, they should be crowned
with fair chaplets of flowers or herbs, as was the custom
of yore, and as is still done with young maids in our day,
this triumph would be good and creditable while it lasted,
and not of over long duration. But now all that may
be given them, is a few words of admiration, the which
do vanish into air so soon as spoken and perish as quick
as the dead man’s corse. Well then, let all fair young
widows recognise the world and its claims, since they be
of it still, and leave religion to old women and the strait
rule to perpetual widowhood.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">7.</p>

<p>Well! enough said of widows which go fasting.
’Tis time now to speak of another sort, to wit
those which detesting all vows and abnegations
against second marriages, do wed again and
once more claim the aid of the gentle and agreeable God
Hymen. Of such there be some which, over fond of their
admirers during their husband’s life, be already dreaming
of another match before these be well dead, planning aforehand
betwixt them and their lovers the sort of life they
will lead together: “Ah, me! an if mine husband were
but dead,” they say, “we would do this, we would do
that; we would live after this pleasant fashion, we would
arrange it after that,—and all so discreetly none should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
ever suspect our bygone loves. A right merry life we
would have of it then; we would go to Paris, to Court,
and bear us so wisely naught should ever do us hurt. You
would pay court to such and such a great lady, I to such
and such a great nobleman; we would get this from the
King, and that. We would get our children provided with
tutors and guardians, and have never a care for their
property and governance. Rather would we be making
our fortunes, or else enjoying theirs, pending their coming
of age. We would have plenishing enough, with that
of mine husband to boot; the last for sure we could not
lack, for I wot well where be the title deeds and good
crown pieces. In a word, who so happy as we should be?”—and
so on and so on.</p>

<p>Such the fine words and pleasant plans these wives do
indulge in to their lovers by anticipation. Some of them
do only kill their husbands in wishes, words, hopes and
longings; but others there be that do actually haste them
on the way to the tomb, if they be over laggard. Cases
of this sort have been, and are yet to-day, more plenty
before our Courts of Law and Parliaments than any would
suppose. But verily ’tis better and more agreeable they
do not as did a certain Spanish dame. For being ill
treated of her husband, she did kill him, and afterward
herself, having first writ this epitaph following, which
she left on the table in her closet, indited in her own
hand:</p>

<p>(Here lieth one which did seek a wife, yet could not satisfy
a wife; to other women, but not me, though near me, he would
give contentment. And for this, and for his cowardice and
insolence, I have killed him, to punish him for his sins. Myself
likewise I have done to death, for lack of understanding,
and to make an end of the unhappy life I had.)</p>
</div>

<p>This lady was named Donna Madallena de Soria, the
which, in the judgment of some, did a fine thing to kill
her husband for the wrong he had done her; but did no
less foolishly to slay herself,—and indeed she doth admit
as much, saying “for lack of understanding she did herself
to death.” She had done better to have led a merry life
afterward, were it not, mayhap, she did fear the law and
dread to get within its clutches, wherefore she did prefer
to triumph over herself rather than trust her repute to
the authority of the Judges. I can assure you, there have
always been, and are yet women more astute than this; for
they do play their game so cunningly and covertly, that
lo! you have the husband gone to another world, and themselves
living a merry life and getting their complaisant
gallants to give ’em no mere artificial joys with <i>godemiches</i>
and the like, but the good, sound, real article.</p>

<p>Other widows there be which do show more wisdom,
virtue and love toward their late husbands, with never a
suspicion of cruelty toward these. Rather they do mourn,
lament and bewail them with such extremity of sorrow
you would think they would not live one hour more.
“Alackaday!” they cry, “am not I the most unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
woman in all the world, and the most ill-starred to have
lost so precious a possession? Gracious God! why dost
not kill me straight, that I may follow him presently to
the tomb? Nay! I care not to live on after him; for
what is left me in this world or can ever come to me, to
give me solace? An it were not for these babes he hath left
me in pledge, and that they do yet need some stay, verily
I would kill myself this very minute. Cursed be the hour
ever I was born! If only I might see his ghost, or behold
him in a vision or dream, or by some magic art, how
blessed should I be e’en now! Oh! sweetheart, sweet soul!
can I in no way follow thee in death? Yea! I will follow
thee, so soon as, free from all human hindrance, I may
be alone and do myself to death. What could make my
life worth living, now I have had so irreparable a loss?
With thee alive I could have no other wish but to live; with
thee dead, no wish but only to die! Well, well! is’t not
better for me to die now in thy love and favour and mine
own good repute and satisfaction, than to drag on so
sorrowful and unhappy a life, wherein is never a scrap
of credit to be gotten? Great God! what ills and torments
I endure by thine absence! what a sweet deliverance, an
if I might but see thee soon again, what a crown of bliss!
Alas! he was so handsome, he was so lovable! He was
another Mars, another Adonis! and more than all, he was
so kind, and loved me so true, and treated me so fondly!
In one word, in losing him, I have lost all mine happiness.”</p>

<p>Such and an infinity of the like words do our heart-broken
widows indulge in after the death of their husbands.
Some will make their moan in one way, others in another,
but always something to the effect of what I have set
down. Some do cry out on heaven, others curse this earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
of ours; some do blaspheme God, others vent their spleen
on the world. Some again do feign to swoon, while others
counterfeit death; some faint away, and others pretend
to be mad and desperate and out of their wits, knowing
no one and refusing to speak. In a word, I should never
have done, if I were to try to specify all the false, feigned,
affected tricks they do use for to prove their grief and
mourning to the world. Of course I speak not of all, but
of some, and a fine few these be and a good round number.</p>

<p>Good folk of either sex that would console suchlike doleful
widows, thinking no ill and supposing their grief genuine,
do but lose their pains and none is a whit the better.
Others again of these comforters, when they see the poor
suffering object of their solicitude failing to keep up
the farce and make the proper grimaces, do instruct them
in their part, like a certain great lady I wot of, which
would tell her daughter, “Now faint, my pet; you don’t
show near enough concern.”</p>

<p>Then presently, after all these wondrous rites performed,
just like a torrent that after dashing headlong
down its course, doth anon subside again and quietly
return to its bed, or like a river that hath overflowed its
banks, so you will see these widows recover them and
return to their former complexion, gradually get back
their spirits, begin to be merry once again and dream of
worldly vanities. Instead of the death’s-heads they were
used to wear, whether painted, engraven or in relief,
instead of dead men’s bones set crosswise or enclosed in
coffins, instead of tears, whether of jet or of enamelled
gold, or simply painted, you will see them now adopt
portraits of their husbands worn round the neck, though
still adorned with death’s-heads and tears painted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
scrolls and the like, in fact sundry little gewgaws, yet
all so prettily set off that spectators suppose they do use
and wear the same rather by way of mourning for their
deceased husbands than for worldly show. Then presently,
just as we see young birds, whenas they quit the
parental nest, do not at the very first make very long
flights, but fluttering from branch to branch do little by
little learn the use of their wings, so these widows, quitting
their mourning habits and desperate grief, do not appear
in public at once, but taking greater and greater freedom
by degrees, do at last throw off their mourning altogether,
and toss their widows’ weeds and flowing veil to the dogs,
as the saying is, and letting love more than ever fill their
heads, do dream of naught else but only a second marriage
or other return to wanton living. So we find their great
and violent sorrow hath no long duration. It had been
better far to have exercised more moderation in their
sorrow.</p>

<p>I knew once a very fair lady, which after her husband’s
death was so woebegone and utterly cast down that she
would tear her hair, and disfigure her cheeks and bosom,
pulling the longest face ever she could. And when folk
did chide her for doing such wrong to her lovely countenance,
“My God!” she would cry, “what would you have?
What use is my pretty face to me now? Who should I
safeguard it for, seeing mine husband is no more?” Yet
some eight months later, who but she is making up her
face with Spanish white and rouge and besprinkling her
locks with powder,—a marvellous change truly?</p>

<p>Hereof I will cite an excellent example, for to prove my
contention, that of a fair and honourable lady of Ephesus,
which having lost her husband could find no consolation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
whatever in spite of all efforts of kinsmen and friends.
Accordingly following her husband’s funeral, with endless
grief and sorrow, with sobs, cries, tears and lamentations,
after he was duly put away in the charnel-house where his
body was to rest, she did throw herself therein in spite of
all that could be done to hinder, swearing and protesting
stoutly she would never leave that place, but would there
tarry to the end and finish her days beside her husband’s
corpse and never, never abandon the same. This resolution
she did hold to, and did actually so live by the space
of two or three days. Meantime, as fortune would have
it, a man of those parts was executed for some crime and
hanged in the city, and afterward carried forth the walls
to the gibbets there situate to the end of the bodies of
malefactors so hanged and put to death should there
remain for an example to others, carefully watched by a
band of officers and soldiers to prevent their being carried
off. So it fell out that a soldier that was guarding the
body, and was standing sentry, did hear near by a very
lamentable voice crying and approaching perceived ’twas
in the charnel-house. Having gone down therein, he beheld
the said lady, as fair and beautiful as day, all bathed in
tears and lamenting sore; and accosting her, set him to
enquiring the reason of her pitiful state, the which she
told him gently enough. Thereupon doing his endeavours
to console her grief, but naught succeeding for the first
time, he did return again and once again. Finally he was
enabled to gain his point, and did little by little comfort
her and got her to dry her eyes; till at length hearkening
to reason, she did yield so far as that he had her twice
over, holding her on her back on the very coffin of her
husband, which did serve as their couch. This done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
they did swear marriage, one with the other; after which
happy consummation, the soldier did return to his duty,
to guard the gibbet,—for ’twas a matter of life and death
to him. But fortunate as he had been in this fine enterprise
of his and its carrying out, his misfortune now was
such that while he was so inordinately taking his pleasure,
lo! the kinsfolk of the poor dangling criminal did steal up,
for to cut the body down, an if they should find it unguarded.
So finding no guard there, they did cut it down
with all speed, and carried the corpse away with them
swiftly, to bury it where they might, to the end they might
rid them of so great dishonour and a sight so foul and
hateful to the dead man’s kindred. The soldier coming
up and finding the body a-missing, hied him in despair to
his mistress, to tell her his calamity and how he was ruined
and undone; for the law of that country was that any
soldier which should sleep on guard and suffer the body
to be carried off, should he put in its place and hanged
instead, which risk he did thus run. The lady, who had
but now been consoled of him, and had felt sore need of
comfort for herself, did quick find the like for him, and
said as follows: “Be not afeared; only come help me to
lift mine husband from his tomb, and we will hang him
and set him up in place of the other; so they will take
him for the other.” No sooner said than done. Moreover
’tis said the first occupant of the gibbet had had an ear
cut off; so she did the same to the second, the better to
preserve the likeness. Next day the officers of justice did
visit the place, but found naught amiss. Thus did she save
her gallant by a most abominable deed and wicked act
toward her husband,—the very same woman, I would have
you note, which had so grievously deplored and lamented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
his loss, so that no man would ever have expected so
shameful an issue.</p>

<p>The first time ever I heard this history, ’twas told by M.
<span class="no-wrap">d’Aurat,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119*]</a></span>
which did relate it to the gallant M. du Gua
and sundry that were dining with him. M. du Gua was
not one to fail to appreciate such a tale and to profit
thereby, no man in all the world loving better a good anecdote
or better able to turn the same to account. Accordingly
soon after, being come into the Queen’s chamber,
he saw there a young, new-made widow, but just bereaved
and all disconsolate, her veil drawn half way down her
face, sad and pitiful, with scarce a word for any man.
Of a sudden M. du Gua said to me: “Dost see yonder
widow? well! before a year be out, she will one day be
doing as the lady of Ephesus did.” And so she did, though
not altogether so shamefully; but she did marry a man of
base condition, even as M. du Gua had foretold.</p>

<p>The same story I had also of M. de Beau-Joyeux, valet
of the chamber to the Queen Mother, and the best violin
player in Christendom. Not only was he perfect in his art
and music generally, but he was likewise of an amiable
disposition, and well instructed, above all in excellent
tales and fine stories, little known and of rare quality.
Of these he was by no means niggardly with his more intimate
friends, and beside could relate sundry from his own
experience, for in his day he had both seen many good
love adventures and had not a few of his own; for what
with his noble gift of music and his good, bold spirit,
two weapons very meet for love, he could carry far. The
Maréchal de Brissac had given him to the Queen Mother,
having sent him to her from Piedmont with his company
of violins, the whole most exquisite and complete. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
then called Baltazarin, but did after change his name.
Of his composition were those pretty ballets that be always
danced at Court. He was a great friend of M. du Gua and
myself; and we would often converse together. On these
occasions he had always some good tale ready to tell,
especially of love and ladies’ wiles. Among such he did
tell us that of the lady of Ephesus, already heard from
M. d’Aurat, as I have mentioned, who said he had it
from Lampridius. Since then I have read it also in the
<i>Book of Obsequies</i> (des Funérailles), a right excellent
work, dedicated to the late M. de Savoie.</p>

<p>The author might surely have spared us this digression,
some may object. Yea!—but then I was fain to make
mention of my friend hereanent, which did oft bring the
story to my mind, whenever he beheld any of our woe-begone
widows. “Look!” he would exclaim, “see yonder
one that will some day play the part of our lady of
Ephesus, or else mayhap she hath played it already.”
And by my faith, ’twas a mighty strange tragi-comedy, an
act full of heartlessness, so cruelly to insult her dead
husband.</p>

<p>At the massacre of the Saint Bartholomew was slain
the Seigneur de Pleuviau, who in his time had been a right
gallant soldier, without a doubt, in the War of Tuscany
under M. de Soubise, as well as in the Civil War, as he did
plainly show at the battle of Jarnac, being in command
of a regiment there, and in the siege of Niort. Some
while after the soldier which had killed him did inform
his late wife, all distraught with grief and tears,—she
was both beautiful and wealthy,—that an if she would
not marry him, he would kill her and make her go the
same way as her husband; for at that merry time, ’twas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
all fighting and cut-throat work. The unhappy woman
accordingly, which was still both young and fair, was
constrained, for to save her life, to celebrate wedding and
funeral all in one. Yet was she very excusable; for
indeed what could a poor fragile, feeble woman have done
else, unless it had been to kill herself, or give her tender
bosom to the murderous steel? But verily</p>

<p>and these fond fanatics of yore exist no more. Beside,
doth not our holy Christian faith forbid it? This is a
grand excuse for all widows nowadays, who always say,—and
if ’twere not forbid of God, they would kill themselves.
Thus do they mask their inaction.</p>

<p>At this same massacre was made another widow, a lady
of very good family and most beauteous and charming.
The same, while, yet in the first desolation of widowhood,
was forced by a gentleman that I know well enough by
name; whereat was she so bewildered and disconsolate she
did well nigh lose her senses for some while. Yet presently
after she did recover her wits and making the best of her
widowhood and going back little by little to worldly vanities
and regaining her natural lively spirits, did forget her
wrongs and make a new match, gallant and high-born.
And in this I ween she did well.</p>

<p>I will tell yet another story of this massacre. Another
lady which was there made a widow by the death of
her husband, murdered like the rest, was in such sorrow
and despair thereat, that whenever she did set eyes on
a poor unoffending Catholic, even though he had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
taken part in the celebration at all, she would either faint
away altogether, or would gaze at him with as much horror
and detestation as though he were the plague. To enter
Paris, nay! to look at it from anywhere in the neighbourhood
within two miles, was not to be thought of, for
neither eyes nor heart could bear the sight. To see it,
say I?—why! she could not bear so much as to hear it
named. At the end of two years, however, she did think
better, and hies her away willingly enough to greet the
good town, and visit the same, and drive to the Palace
in her coach. Yet rather than pass by the Rue de la
Huchette, where her husband had been killed, she would
have thrown herself headlong into fire and destruction
rather than into the said street,—being herein like the
serpent, which according to Pliny, doth so abhor the shade
of the ash as that ’twill rather adventure into the most
blazing fire than under this tree so hateful is it to the
creature.</p>

<p>In fact, the late King, the then reigning King’s brother,
was used to declare he had never seen a woman so desperate
and haggard at her loss and grief as this lady,
and that ’twould end by their having to bring her down
and hood her, as they do with haggard falcons. But after
some while he found she was prettily enough tamed of her
own accord, in such sort she would suffer herself to be
hooded quite quietly and privily, without any bringing
down but her own will. Then after some while more, what
must she be at but embrace her Paris with open arms and
regard its pleasures with a very favourable eye, parading
hither and thither through its streets, traversing the city
up and down, and measuring its length and breadth this
way and that, without ever a thought of any vow to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
contrary. Mighty surprised was I myself one day, on returning
from a journey, after an absence of eight months
from Court, when after making my bow to the King, I
did suddenly behold this same widow entering the great
Hall of the Louvre, all tricked out and bedecked, accompanied
by her kinswomen and friends, and there appearing
before the King and Queen, the Royal personages and
all the Court, and there receiving the first orders of marriage,
affiancing to wit, at the hands of a Prelate, the
Bishop of Digne, Grand Almoner of the Queen of Navarre.
Who so astonished as I? Yet by what she did tell me
after, she was even more astounded, whenas thinking
me far away, she saw me among the noble company present
at her affiancing, standing there gazing at her and challenging
her with mine eyes. Neither of us could forget
the oaths and affirmations made betwixt us, for I had been
her admirer and suitor for her hand and indeed she
thought I had come thither of set purpose to appear on
the appointed day to be witness against her and judge
of her faithlessness, and condemn her false behaviour.
She told me further, how that she would liever have given
ten thousand crowns of her wealth than that I should
have appeared as I did, and so helped to raise up her
conscience against her.</p>

<p>I once knew a very great lady, a widowed Countess, of
the highest family, which did the like. For being a
Huguenot of the most rigorous sort, she did agree to a
match with a very honourable Catholic gentleman. But the
sad thing was that before the completion of the marriage,
a pestilential fever that was epidemic at Paris did seize
her so sore as to bring her to her end. In her anguish,
she did give way to many and bitter regrets, crying:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
“Alas! can it be that in a great city like Paris, where all
learning doth abound, never a doctor can be found to
cure me! Nay! let him never stop for money; I will give
him enough and to spare. At any rate ’twere not so bitter,
an if my death had but come after my marriage, and
my husband had learned first how well I loved and honoured
him!” (Sophonisba said differently, for she did repent
her of having wedded before drinking the poison.)
Saying these and other words of like tenour the poor
Countess did turn her to the other side of the bed, and so
died. Truly this is the very fervour of love, so to go about
to remember, in midst of the Stygian passage to oblivion,
the pleasures and fruits of passion she would so fain
have tasted of, before quitting the garden!</p>

<p>I have heard speak of another lady, which being sick
unto death, overhearing one of her kinsfolk abusing another
(yet are they very worthy folk really), and upbraiding
her with the enormous size of her parts, she did
start a-laughing and cried out, “You pair of fools, you!”
and so turning o’ the other side, she did pass away with
the laugh on her lips.</p>

<p>Well! an if these Huguenot dames have made such
matches, I have likewise known plenty of Catholic ladies
that have done the same, and wedded Huguenot husbands,
and that after using every hang-dog expression of them
and their religion. If I were to put them all down, I
should never have done. And this is why your widow
should always be prudent, and not make so much noise at
the first beginning of her widowhood, screaming and crying,
making storms of thunder and lightning, with tears
for rain, only afterward to give up her shield of defence
and get well laughed at for her pains. Better far it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
were to say less, and do more. But themselves do say to
this: “Nay! nay! at the first beginning we must needs
steel our hearts like a murderer, and put on a bold front,
resolved to swallow every shame. This doth last a while,
but only a while; then presently, after being chief dish
on the table and most observed of all, we be left alone and
another takes our place.”</p>

<p>I have read in a little Spanish work how Vittoria
Colonna, daughter of the great Fabrice Colonna, and
wife to the great and famous Marquis de Pescaïre, the
nonpareil of his time, after losing her husband,—and God
alone knoweth how good an one he was,—did fall into such
despair and grief ’twas impossible to give or afford her
any consolation whatever. When any did offer any form
of comfort, old or new, she would answer them: “For
what would you give me consolation?—for my husband
that is dead? Nay! you deceive yourselves; he is not
dead. He is yet alive, I tell you, and stirring within mine
heart. I do feel him, every day and every night, come to
life and move and be born again in me.” Very noble
words indeed these had been, if only after some while,
having taken farewell of him and sent him on his way
over Acheron, she had not married again with the Abbé
de Farfe,—an ill match to the noble Pescaïre. I mean
not in family, for he was of the noble house of the Des
Ursins, the which is as good, and eke as ancient, as that
of Avalos,—or more so. But the merits of the one did far
outweight those of the other, for truly those of Pescaïre
were inestimable, and his valour beyond compare, while the
said Abbé, albeit he gave much proof of his bravery, and
did work very faithfully and doughtily in the service of
King Francis, was yet employed only in small, obscure and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
light emprises, far different from those of the other,
which had wrought great and conspicuous deeds, and won
right famous victories. Moreover the profession of arms
followed by the Marquis, begun and regularly pursued
from his youth up, could not but be finer far than that
of a churchman, which had but late in life taken up the
hardier calling.</p>

<p>Saying this, I mean not to imply thereby think ill of
any which after being vowed to God and the service of
his Church, have broke the vow and left the profession of
religion for to set hands to weapons of war; else should
I be wronging many and many a great Captain that hath
been a priest first and gone through this experience.</p>

<p>Cæsar
<span class="no-wrap">Borgia,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120*]</a></span>
Duc de Valentinois, was
he not first of all a Cardinal, the same
which afterward was so great a Captain that
Machiavelli, the venerable instructor of
Princes and great folk, doth set him down for example
and mirror to all his fellows, to follow after and mould
them on him? Then we have had the famous Maréchal
de Foix, which was first a Churchman and known as the
Protonotary de Foix, but afterward became a great Captain.
The Maréchal Strozzi likewise was first vowed to
holy Church; but for a red hat which was refused him,
did quit the cassock and take to arms. M. de Salvoison,
of whom I have spoke before (which did follow close at
the former’s heels, and was as fit as he to bear the title
of great Captain,—and indeed would have marched side
by side with him, an if he had been of as great a house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
and kinsman of the Queen), was, by original profession,
a wearer of the long robe; yet what a soldier was he!
Truly he would have been beyond compare, if only he had
lived longer. Then the Maréchal de Bellegarde, did he
not carry the lawyer cap, being long named the Provost
of Ours? The late M. d’Enghien, the same that fell at
the battle of St. Quentin, had been a Bishop; the Chevalier
de Bonnivet the same. Likewise that gallant soldier M. de
Martigues had been of the Church; and, in brief, an host
of others, whose names I cannot spare paper to fill in. I
must say a word too of mine own people, and not without
good cause. Captain Bourdeille, mine own brother, erst
the Rodomont of Piedmont in all ways, was first dedicate
to the Church. But not finding that to be his natural
bent, he did change his cassock for a soldier’s jacket, and
in a turn of the hand did make him one of the best and
most valiant captains in all Piedmont. He would for
sure have become a great and famous man, had he not
died, alas! at only five and twenty years of age.</p>

<p>In our own day and at our own Court of France, we
have seen many such, and above all our little friend, the
noble Clermont-Tallard, whom I had seen as Abbé of Bon-Port,
but who afterward leaving his Abbey, was seen in
our army and at Court, one of the bravest, most valiant
and worthy men of the time. This he did show right well
by his glorious death at La Rochelle, the very first time
we did enter the fosse of that fortress. I could name
a thousand such, only I should never have done. M. de
<span class="no-wrap">Soleillas,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span>
known as the young Oraison, had been Bishop
of Riez and after had a regiment, serving his King right
faithfully and valiantly in Guienne, under the Maréchal
de Matignon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span></p>

<p>In short I should never have done, an if I were for
enumerating all such cases. Wherefore I do stop, both
for brevity’s sake, and also for fear I be reproached for
that I indulge overmuch in digressions. Yet is this one
not inopportune I have made, when speaking of Vittoria
Colonna which did marry the Abbé. An if she had not
married again with him, she had better deserved her name
and title of Vittoria, by being victorious over herself.
Seeing she could not find a second husband to match the
first, she should have refrained her altogether.</p>

<p>I have known many ladies which have copied her however.
One I knew did marry one of mine uncles, the
most brave, valiant and perfect gentleman of his time.
After his death, she did marry another as much like him
as an ass to a Spanish charger; but ’twas mine uncle
was the Spanish steed. Another lady I knew once, which
had wedded a Marshal of
<span class="no-wrap">France,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122*]</a></span>
a handsome, honourable
gentleman and a valiant; in second wedlock she did take
one in every way his opposite, and one that had been a
Churchman too. What was yet more blameworthy in her
was this, that on going to Court, where she had not appeared
for twenty years, not indeed since her second marriage,
she did re-adopt the name and title of her first
husband. This is a matter our courts of law and parliament
should look into and legislate against; for I have
seen an host of others which have done the like, herein
unduly scorning their later husbands, and showing them
unwilling to bear their name after their death. For having
committed the fault, why! they should drink the cup
to the dregs and feel themselves bound by what they have
done.</p>

<p>Another widow I once knew, on her husband’s dying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
did make such sore lamentation and so despairing by the
space of a whole year, that ’twas hourly expected to see
her dead right off. At the end of a year, when she was
to leave off her heavy mourning and take to the lighter,
she said to one of her women: “Prithee, pull me in that
crêpe becomingly; for mayhap I may make another conquest.”
But immediately she did interrupt herself:
“Nay! what am I talking about? I am dreaming. Better
die than have anything more to do with such follies.”
Yet after her mourning was complete, she did marry
again to a husband very unequal to the first. “But,”—and
this is what these women always say,—“he was of as
good family as the other.” Yes! I admit it; but then,
what of virtue and worth? are not these more worth
counting than all else? The best I find in it all is this,
that the match once made, their joy therein is far from
long; for God doth allow them to be properly ill-treated
of their new lords and bullied. Soon you will see them
all repentance,—when it is too late.</p>

<p>These dames which do thus re-marry have some opinion
or fancy in their heads we wot not of. So have I
heard speak of a Spanish lady, which desiring to marry
again, when they did remonstrate with her, asking what
was to become of the fond love her husband had borne
her, did make answer: <i>La muerte del marido y nuevo
casamiento no han de romper el amor d’una casta muger</i>,—“The
death of husband and a new marriage should in no
wise break up the love of a good woman.” Well! so much
shall be granted, an if you please. Another Spanish
dame said better, when they were for marrying her again:
<i>Si hallo un marido bueno, no quiero tener el temor de
perderlo; y si malo, que necessidad he del</i>,—“An if I find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
a good husband, I wish not to be exposed to the fear of
losing him; but if a bad, what need to have one at all?”</p>

<p>Valeria, a Roman lady, having lost her husband, whenas
some of her companions were condoling with her on his
loss and death, said thus to them: “’Tis too true he is
dead for you all, but he liveth in me for ever.” The fair
Marquise I have spoke of a little above, had borrowed
a like phrase from her. These expressions of these noble
ladies do differ much from what a Spanish ill-wisher of
the sex declared, to wit: <i>que la jornada de la biudez d’
una muger es d’un dia</i>,—“that the day of a woman’s
widowhood is one day long.” A lady I must now tell of
did much worse. This was Madame de Moneins, whose
husband was King’s lieutenant, and was massacred at Bordeaux,
by the common folk in a salt-excise riot. So soon
as ever news was brought her that her husband had been
killed and had met the fate he did, she did straight cry
out: “Alas! my diamond, what hath become of it?” This
she had given him by way of marriage present, being
worth ten to twelve hundred crowns of the money of the
day, and he was used to wear it always on his finger. By
this exclamation she did let folk plainly see which grief
she did bear the more hardly, the loss of her husband or
that of the diamond.</p>

<p>Madame d’Estampes was a high favourite with King
Francis, and for that cause little loved of her husband.
Once when some widow or other came to her asking her
pity for her widowed state, “Why! dear heart,” said she,
“you are only too happy in your condition, for I tell you,
one cannot be a widow by wishing for’t,”—as if implying
she would love to be one. Some women be so situate,
others not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span></p>

<p>But what are we to say of widows which do keep their
marriage hid, and will not have it published? One such I
knew, which did keep hers under press for more than seven
or eight years, without ever consenting to get it printed
and put in circulation. ’Twas said she did so out of terror
of her
<span class="no-wrap">son,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123*]</a></span>
as yet only a youth, but afterward one of
the bravest and most honourable men in all the world,
lest he should play the deuce with her and her man, albeit
he was of very high rank. But so soon as ever her son
fell in a warlike engagement, dying so as to win a crown
of glory, she did at once have her marriage printed off
and published abroad.</p>

<p>I have heard of another widow, a great lady, which
was married to a very great nobleman and Prince, more
than fifteen years agone. Yet doth the world know nor
hear aught thereof, so secret and discreet is it kept. Report
saith the Prince was afeared of his mother-in-law,
which was very imperious with him, and was most unwilling
he should marry again because of his young children.</p>

<p>I knew another very great lady, which died but a short
while agone, having been married to a simple gentleman
for more than twenty years, without its being known at
all, except by mere gossip and hearsay. Ho! but there
be some queer cases of the sort!</p>

<p>I have heard it stated by a lady of a great and ancient
house, how that the late Cardinal du Bellay was wedded,
being then Bishop and Cardinal, to Madame de Chastillon,
and did die a married man. This she did declare in a
conversation she held with M. de Mane, a Provençal, of
the house of Senjal and Bishop of Fréjus, which had
served the said Cardinal for fifteen years at the Court of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
Rome, and had been one of his privy protonotaries.
Well! happening to speak of the Cardinal, she did ask
M. de Mane if he had ever told him or confessed to him
that he was married. Who so astounded as M. de Mane
at such a question? He is yet alive and can contradict
me, if I lie; for I was present. He made answer he had
never heard him speak of it, either to him or to others.
“Well, then! I am the first to tell you,” she replied; “for
nothing is more true than that he was so married; and he
died actually the husband of the said Madame de Chastillon,
before a widow.” I can assure you I had a fine
laugh, seeing the astonished face of poor M. de Mane,
who was a very careful and religious man, and thought
he knew every secret of his late master; but he was out
of court for this one. And indeed ’twas a scandalous
license on the Cardinal’s part, considering the sacred office
he held.</p>

<p>This Madame de Chastillon was the widow of the late
M. de Chastillon, the same which was said to chiefly govern
the young King Charles VIII. along with Bourdillon,
Galiot and Bonneval, the guardians of the blood royal.
He died at Ferrara, having been wounded at the siege
of Ravenna, and carried thither to be healed. She became
a widow when very young, being both fair and also
wise and virtuous,—albeit but in appearance, as witness
this marriage of hers,—and so was chosen maid of honour
to the late Queen of Navarre. She it was that did tender
the excellent advice to this noble lady and great Princess,
which is writ in the <i>Cent Nouvelles</i> of the said Queen.
The tale is of her and a certain gentleman which had
slipped by night into her bed by a little trap-door in the
wainscot beside her bed, and was fain to enjoy the reward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
of his address; yet did win naught but some fine scratches
on his pretty face. The Queen being purposed to make
complaint of the matter to her brother, he did remonstrate
with her very judiciously, as may be read in the
<i>Nouvelle</i> or Tale in question, and did give her the excellent
advice referred to, as good and judicious and as
well adapted to avoid scandal as could possibly be devised.
Indeed it might have been a First President of the Parliament
of Paris that gave the advice, which did show
plainly, however, the lady to be no less skilled and experienced
in such mysteries than wise and judicious; wherefore
there can be little doubt she did keep her affair with
the Cardinal right well hidden.</p>

<p>My grandmother, the Séneschale de Poitou, had her
place after her death, by choice of King Francis himself,
which did name and elect her to the post, sending all
the way to her home to summon her. Then he did give
her over with his own hand to the Queen his sister, forasmuch
as he knew her to be a very prudent and very virtuous
lady,—indeed he was used to call her <i>my knight
without reproach</i>,—albeit not so experienced, adroit and
cunning in suchlike matters as her predecessor, nor one
that had contracted a second marriage under the rose.
But an if you would know who are intended in the Tale,
’twas writ of the Queen of Navarre herself and the Admiral
de Bonnivet, as I have been assured by my grandmother.
Yet doth it appear to me the Queen need never
have been at pains to conceal her name, seeing the other
could get no hold over her virtue, but did leave her all in
confusion. Indeed she was only too wishful to make the
facts public, had it not been for the good and wise advice
given her by that same maid of honour, Madame de Chastillon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
Anyone that hath read the Tale will find it as I
have represented it. And I do believe that the Cardinal,
her husband as aforesaid, which was one of the cleverest
and wisest, most eloquent, learned and well-advised men
of his day, had instilled this discreetness in her mind, to
make her speak so well and give such excellent counsel.
The tale might mayhap be thought somewhat over scandalous
by some in view of the sacred and priestly profession
of the Cardinal; but, an if any be fain to repeat the
same, well! he must e’en suppress the name.</p>

<p>Well! if this marriage was kept secret, ’twas by no
means so with that of the last Cardinal de
<span class="no-wrap">Chastillon.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124*]</a></span>
For indeed he did divulge and make it public quite enough
himself, without need to borrow any trumpet; and did
die a married man, without ever having quitted his gown
and red hat. On the one hand he did excuse himself
by alleging the reformed faith, whereof he was a firm
adherent; on the other by the contention that he was
desirous of still retaining his rank and not giving up the
same (a thing he would most surely never have done in
any case), so as he might continue of the council, whereof
being a member he could well serve his faith and party.
For ’tis very true he was a most able, influential and very
powerful personage.</p>

<p>I do imagine the aforenamed noble Cardinal du Bellay
may have done the like for like reasons. For at that
time he was no little inclined to the faith and doctrine of
Luther, and indeed the Court of France generally was
somewhat affected by the taint. The fact is, all novelties
be pleasing at first, and beside, the said doctrine
did open an agreeable license to all men, and especially
to ecclesiastics, to enter the married state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">9.</p>

<p>However let us say no more of these dignified
folk, in view of the deep respect we do owe
their order and holy rank. We must now
something put through their paces those old
widows we wot of that have not six teeth left in their
chops, and yet do marry again. ’Tis no long while
agone that a lady of Guienne, already widowed of three
husbands, did marry for a fourth a gentleman of some
position in that province, she being then eighty. I know
not why she did it, seeing she was very rich and had
crowns in plenty,—indeed ’twas for this the gentleman
did run after her,—unless it were that she was fain not
to surrender just yet, but to win more amorous laurels
to add to her old ones, as Mademoiselle Sevin, the Queen
of Navarre’s jester, was used to say.</p>

<p>Another great lady I knew, which did remarry at the
age of seventy-six, wedding a gentleman of a lower rank
than her previous husband, and did live to an hundred.
Yet did she continue beautiful to the last, having been
one of the finest women of her time, and one that had
gotten every sort of delight out of her young body, both
as wife and widow, so ’twas said.</p>

<p>Truly a formidable pair of women, and of a right hot
complexion! And indeed I have heard experienced bakers
declare how that an old oven is far easier to heat than a
new one, and when once heated, doth better keep its heat
and make better bread.</p>

<p>I wot not what savoury appetites they be which do stir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
husbands and lovers to prefer these hot-loaf dainties; but
I have seen many gallant and brave gentlemen no less
eager in love, nay! more eager, for old women than for
young. They tell me ’twas to get worldly profit of them;
but some I have seen also, which did love such with most
ardent passion, without winning aught from their purse
at all, except that of their person. So have we all seen
erstwhile a very great and sovran
<span class="no-wrap">Prince,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span>
which did so
ardently love a great dame, a widow and advanced in
years, that he did desert his wife and all other women, no
matter how young and lovely, for to sleep with her only.
Yet herein was he well advised, seeing she was one of the
fairest and most delightsome women could ever be seen,
and for sure her winter was better worth than the springtide,
summer and autumn of the rest. Men which have
had dealings with the courtesans of Italy have seen, and
do still see, not a few cases where lovers do choose the
most famous and long experienced in preference, and those
that have most shaken their skirts, hoping with them to
find something more alluring in body or in wit. And
this is why the beauteous Cleopatra, being summoned of
Mark Antony to come see him, was moved with no apprehension,
being well assured that, inasmuch as she had
known how to captivate Julius Cæsar and Gnæus Pompeius,
the son of Pompey the Great, when she was yet
but a slip of a girl, and knew not thoroughly the ways
and wiles of her trade, she could manage better still her
new lover, a very fleshly and coarse soldier of a man, now
that she was in the full fruition of her experience and
ripe age. Nor did she fail. In fact, the truth is that,
while youth is most meet to attract the love of some men,
with others ’tis maturity, a sufficient age, a practised wit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
a long experience, a well-hung tongue and a well trained
hand, that do best serve to seduce them.</p>

<p>There is one doubtful point as to which I did one time
ask doctors’ opinion,—a question suggested by one who
asked why his health was not better, seeing all his life
long he had never known nor touched old women, according
to the physicians’ aphorism which saith: <i>vetulam non
cognovi</i>, “I have known never an old woman.” Among
many other quaint matters, be sure of this,—these doctors
did tell me an old proverb which saith: “In an old
barn is fine threshing, but an old flail is good for naught.”
Others say: “Never mind how old a beast be, so it will
bear.” I was told moreover that in their practice they
had known old women which were so ardent and hot-blooded,
that cohabiting with a young man, they do draw
all ever they can from him, taking whatever he hath of
substance, the better to moisten their own drouth; I speak
of such as by reason of age be dried up and lack proper
humours. The same medical authorities did give me other
reasons to boot; but an if readers be still curious, I leave
them to ask further for themselves.</p>

<p>I have seen an aged widow, and a great lady too, which
did put under her tooth in less than four years a third
husband and a young nobleman she had taken for lover;
and did send the pair of them under the sod, not by violence
or poison, but by mere enfeeblement and distillation of
their substance. Yet to look at this lady, none had ever
supposed her capable of aught of the sort; for indeed,
before folk she did rather play the prude and poor-spirited
hypocrite, actually refusing to change her shift in
presence of her women for fear of their seeing her naked.
But as one of her kinswomen declared, these objections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
were all for her women, not for her lovers and admirers.</p>

<p>But come, what is the difference in merit and repute
betwixt a woman which hath had several husbands in her
life,—and there be plenty that have had as many as three,
four or even five, and another which in her life shall have
had but her husband and a lover, or two or three,—and
I have actually known some women continent and faithful
to that degree? As to this, I have heard a noble lady
of the great world say she found naught to choose betwixt
a lady who had had several husbands, and one that had
had but a lover or so, along with her husband,—unless
it be that the marriage veil doth cover a multitude of
sins. But in point of sensuality and naughtiness, she said
there was not a doit of difference. Herein do they but
illustrate the Spanish proverb, which saith that <i>algunas
mugeres son de natura de anguilas en retener, y de lobas
en excoger</i>,—“some women are like eels to hold, and she-wolves
to choose,” for that the eel is mighty slippery and
ill to hold, and the she-wolf doth alway choose the ugliest
wolf for mate.</p>

<p>It befell me once at Court, as I have described elsewhere,
that a lady of a sufficiently exalted rank, which
had been four times married, did happen to tell me she
had just been dining with her brother-in-law, and I must
guess who ’twas. This she said quite simply, without any
thought of roguishness; and I answered with a touch of
waggery, yet laughing the while: “Am I a diviner to guess
such a riddle? You have been married four times: I
leave to the imagination how many brothers-in-law you
may have.” To this she retorted: “Nay! but you speak
knavishly,” and named me the particular brother-in-law.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
“Now you do talk sense,” I said then; “before you were
talking all at large.”</p>

<p>There was in old days at
<span class="no-wrap">Rome<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span>
a lady which had had
two and twenty husbands one after other, and similarly a
man which had had one and twenty wives. The pair did
hereupon bethink them to make a suitable match by remarrying
once more to each other. Eventually the husband
did outlive the wife; and was so highly honoured and
esteemed at Rome of all the people for this his noble
victory, that like a successful General, he was promenaded
up and down in a triumphal car, crowned with
laurel and palm in hand. A splendid victory truly, and
a well deserved triumph!</p>

<p>In the days of King Henri II., there was at his Court
a certain Seigneur de Barbazan, Saint-Amand by surname,
which did marry thrice—three wives one after
other. His third was daughter of Madame de Monchy,
governess to the Duchesse de Lorraine, who more doughty
than the other two, did quite surpass them, for he died
under her. Now whenas folk were mourning his loss at
Court, and she in like wise was inordinately afflicted at
her bereavement, M. de Montpezat, a very witty man, did
rebuke all this demonstration, saying: that instead of
compassionating her, they should commend and extol her
to the skies for the victory she had gotten over her man,
who was said to have been so vigorous a wight and so
strong and well provided that he had killed his two first
wives by dint of doing his devoir on them. But this lady,
for that she had not succumbed in the contest but had
remained victorious, should be highly praised and admired
of all the Court for so glorious a success,—a victory won
over so valiant and robust a champion; and that for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
same cause herself had every reason to be proud. What
a victory, and what a source of pride, pardy!</p>

<p>I have heard the same doctrine cited a little above
maintained also by a great nobleman of France, who said:
that he did find no difference ’twixt a woman that had had
four or five husbands, as some have had, and a whore
which hath had three or four lovers one after other.
Similarly a gallant gentleman I wot of, having wedded
a wife that had been three times married already, one
I also know by name, a man of ready tongue and wit,
did exclaim: “He hath married at last a whore from the
brothel of good name.” I’faith, women which do thus
marry again and again be like grasping surgeons, that
will not at once bind up the wounds of a poor wounded
man, so as to prolong the cure and the better to be gaining
all the while their bits of fees. Nay! one dame of this
sort was used actually to say outright: “’Tis a poor
thing to stop dead in the very middle of one’s career; one
is bound to finish, and go on to the end!”</p>

<p>I do wonder that these women which be so hot and
keen to marry again, and at the same time so stricken
in years, do not for their credit’s sake make some use of
cooling remedies and antiphlogistic potions, so as to drive
out all these heated humours. Yet so far be they from
any wish to use the like, as that they do employ the very
opposite treatment, declaring suchlike cooling boluses
would ruin their stomach. I have seen and read a little
old-fashioned tract in Italian, but a silly book withal,
which did undertake to give recipes against lasciviousness,
and cited some two and thirty. But these be all so silly
I recommend not women to use them, nor to submit themselves
to any such annoying regimen. And so I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
not thought good to copy them in here. Pliny doth
adduce one, which in former days the Vestal virgins were
used to employ; the Athenian dames did resort to the
same remedy during the festivals of the goddess Ceres,
known as the <i>Thesmophoria</i>, to cool their humours thereby
and take away all hot appetite of concupiscence. ’Twas
to sleep on mattresses of the leaves of a tree called the
<i>agnus castus</i>. But be sure, an if during the feast they
did mortify themselves in this wise, after the same was
over, they did very soon pitch their mattresses to the
winds.</p>

<p>I have seen a tree of the sort at a house in Guienne
belonging to a very high-born, honourable and beautiful
lady. She would oft times show the tree to strangers
which came thither as a great rarity, and tell them its
peculiar property. But devil take me if ever I have seen
or heard tell of woman or dame that hath sent to gather
one single branch, or made the smallest scrap of mattress
from its leaves. Certainly not the lady that owned the
said tree, who might have made what use she pleased
thereof. Truly, it had been a pity an if she had, and her
husband had not been best pleased; for so fair and charming
a dame was she, ’twas only right nature should be
allowed her way, and she hath borne to boot a noble line
of offspring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">10.</p>

<p>And to speak truth, suchlike harsh, chill medicines
should be left to poor nuns and prescribed
to them only, which for all their fasting
and mortifying of the flesh, be oft times
sore assailed, poor creatures, with temptations of the
flesh. An if only they had their freedom, they would be
ready enough, at least some would, to take like refreshment
with their more worldly sisters, and not seldom do
they repent them of their repentance. This is seen with
the Roman courtesans, as to one of whom I must tell a
diverting tale. She was vowed to take the veil, but before
her going finally to the nunnery, a former lover of hers,
a gentleman of France, doth come to bid her farewell,
ere she entered the cloister forever. But before leaving
her, he did ask one more gratification of his passion, and
she did grant the same, with these words: <i>Fate dunque
presto; ch’ adesso mi veranno cercar per far mi monaca,
e menare al monasterio</i>,—“Do it quick then, for they be
coming directly to make me a nun and carry me off to
cloister.” We must suppose she was fain to do it this
once as a final treat, and say with the Roman poet:
<i>Tandem hæc olim meminisse juvabit</i>,—“’Twill be good
to remember in future days this last delight.” A strange
repentance insooth and a quaint novitiate! But truly
when once they be professed, at any rate the good-looking
ones, (though of course there be exceptions), I do believe
they live more on the bitter herb of repentance than any
other bodily or spiritual sustenance.</p>

<p>Some however there be which do contrive a remedy for
this state of things, whether by dispensation or by sheer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
license they do take for themselves. For in our lands
they have no such dire treatment to fear as the Romans
in old days did mete out to their Vestal virgins which
had gone astray. This was verily hateful and abominable
in its cruelty; but then they were pagans and abounding
in horrors and cruelties. On the contrary we Christians,
which do follow after the gentleness of our Lord Christ,
should be tender-hearted as he was, and forgiving as he
was forgiving. I would describe here in writing the fashion
of their punishment; but for very horror my pen
doth refuse to indite the same.</p>

<p>Let us now leave these poor recluses, which I do verily
believe, once they be shut up in their nunneries, do endure
no small hardship. So a Spanish lady one time, seeing
them setting to the religious life a very fair and honourable
damsel, did thus exclaim: <i>O tristezilla, y en que
pecasteis, que tan presto vienes à penitencia, y seis metida
en sepultura viva!</i>—“Poor creature, what so mighty sin
have you done, that you be so soon brought to penitence
and thus buried alive!” And seeing the nuns offering her
every complaisance, compliment and welcome, she said:
<i>que todo le hedia, hasta el encienso de la yglesia</i>,—“that
it all stank in her nostrils, to the very incense in the
church.”</p>

<p>Now as to these vows of virginity, Heliogabalus did
promulgate a law to the effect that no Roman maid,
not even a Vestal virgin, was bound to perpetual virginity,
saying how that the female sex was over weak
for women to be bound to a pact they could never be
sure of keeping. And for this reason they that have
founded hospitals for the nourishing, rescuing and marrying
poor girls, have done a very charitable work, no less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
to enable these to taste the sweet fruit of marriage than
to turn them from naughtiness. So Panurge in Rabelais,
did give much wealth of his to make such marriages, and
especially in the case of old and ugly women, for with
such was need of more expenditure of money than for the
pretty ones.</p>

<p>One question there is I would fain have resolved in all
sincerity and without concealment of any kind by some
good lady that hath made the journey,—to wit, when
women be married a second time, how they be affected
toward the memory of their first husband. ’Tis a general
maxim hereanent, that later friendships and enmities do
always make the earlier ones forgot; in like wise will a
second marriage bury the thought of the first. As to
this I will now give a diverting example, though from an
humble source,—not that it should therefore be void of
authority and to be rejected, if it be as they say, that
albeit in an obscure and common quarter, yet may wisdom
and good intelligence be hid there. A great lady of Poitou
one day asking a peasant woman, a tenant of hers,
how many husbands she had had, and how she found
them, the latter, bobbing her little country curtsey, did
coolly answer: “I’ll tell you, Madam; I’ve had two husbands,
praise the Lord! One was called Guillaume, he
was the first; and the second was called Collas. Guillaume
was a good man, easy in his circumstances, and did
treat me very well; but there, God have good mercy on
Collas’ soul, for Collas did his duty right well by me.”
But she did actually say the word straight out without
any glozing or disguise such as I have thrown over it.
Prithee, consider how the naughty wench did pray God
for the dead man which was so good a mate and so lusty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
and for what benefit, to wit that he had covered her so
doughtily; but of the first, never a word of the sort. I
should suppose many dames that do wed a second time
and a third do the same; for after all this is their chiefest
reason for marrying again, and he that doth play this
game the best, is best loved. Indeed they do always
imagine the second husband must need be a fierce performer,—though
very oft they be sore deceived, not finding
in the shop the goods they did there think to find. Or
else, if there be some provision, ’tis oft so puny, wasted
and worn, so slack, battered, drooping and dilapidated,
they do repent them ever they invested their money in the
bargain. Of this myself have seen many examples, that
I had rather not adduce.</p>

<p>We read in Plutarch how Cleomenes, having wedded the
fair Agiatis, wife of Agis, after the death of the latter,
did grow fondly enamoured of the same by reason of her
surpassing beauty. He did not fail to note the great
sadness she lay under for her first husband’s loss; and
felt so great compassion for her, as that he made no
grievance of the love she still bare her former husband,
and the affectionate memory she did cherish of him. In
fact, himself would often turn the discourse to her earlier
life, asking her facts and details as to the pleasures that
had erstwhile passed betwixt them twain. He had her not
for long however, for she soon died, to his extreme sorrow.
’Tis a thing not a few worthy husbands do in the
case of fair widows they have married.</p>

<p>But ’tis time now surely, methinks, to be making an
end, if ever end is to be made.</p>

<p>Other ladies there be which declare they do much better
love their second husbands than their first. “For as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
our first husbands,” some of these have told me, “these
we do more often than not take at the orders of our
King or the Queen our mistress, or at the command of
our fathers, mothers, kinsmen, or guardians, not by our
own unbiased wish. On the other hand, once widowed
and thus free and emancipated, we do exercise such choice
as seemeth us good, and take new mates solely for our
own good will and pleasure, for delight of love and the
satisfaction of our heart’s desire.” Of a surety there
would seem to be good reason here, were it not that very
oft, as the old-time proverb saith,—“Love that begins
with a ring, oft ends with a halter.” So every day do
we see instances and examples where women thinking to
be well treated of their husbands, the which they have in
some cases rescued from justice and the gibbet, from
poverty and misery and the hangman, and saved alive,
have been sore beaten, bullied, cruelly entreated and often
done to death of the same,—a just punishment of heaven
for their base ingratitude toward their former husbands,
that were only too good to them, and of whom they had
never a good word to say.</p>

<p>These were in no way like one I have heard tell of,
who the first night of her marriage, when now her husband
was beginning his assault, did start sobbing and
sighing very sore, so that at one and the same time she
was in two quite opposite states, cold and hot, winter and
summer, both at once. Her husband asking her what
cause she had to be so sad, and if he were not doing his
devoir well, “Alas! too well, good sir!” she made answer;
“but I am thinking of mine other husband, which did so
earnestly pray me again and again never to marry afresh
after his death, but to bear in mind and have compassion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
on his young children. Alackaday! I see plainly I
shall have the like ado with you. Woe’s me! what <i>shall</i>
I do? I do think, an if he can see me from the place he
now is in, he will be cursing me finely.” What an idea,
never to have thought on this afore, nor to have felt remorse
but when ’twas all too late! But the husband did
soon appease her, and expel this fancy by the best method
possible; then next morning throwing wide the chamber
window, he did cast forth all memory of the former husband.
For is there not an old proverb which saith, “A
woman that burieth one husband, will think little of burying
another,” and another, “There’s more grimace than
grief, when a woman loseth her husband.”</p>

<p>I knew another widow, a great lady, which was quite
the opposite of the last, and did not weep one whit the
first night. For then, and the second to boot, she did
go so lustily to work with her second husband as that
they did break down and burst the bedstead, and this
albeit she had a kind of cancer on one breast. Yet notwithstanding
her affliction, she did miss never a point of
amorous delight; and often afterward would divert him
with tales of the folly and ineptitude of her former mate.
And truly, by what I have heard sundry of either sex
tell me, the very last thing a second husband doth desire
of his wife is to be entertained with the merits and worth
of her first, as though jealous of the poor departed wight,
who would like naught so well as to return to earth
again; but as for abuse of him, as much of that as ever
you please! Natheless there be not a few that will ask
their wives about their former lords, as did Cleomenes;
but this they do, as feeling themselves to be strong and
vigorous; and so delighting to institute comparisons, do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
cross-question them concerning the other’s sturdiness and
vigour in these sweet encounters. In like wise have I
heard of some which to put their bedfellows in better case,
do lead them to think their former mates were prentice
hands compared with them, a device that doth oft times
answer their purpose well. Others again will say just
the opposite, and declare their first husbands were perfect
giants, so as to spur on their new mates to work
like very pack mules.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">11.</p>

<p>Widows of the sort just described would be in
good case in the island of
<span class="no-wrap">Chios,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127*]</a></span>
the fairest,
sweetest and most pleasant of the Levant,
formerly possessed by the Genoese, but now
for five and thirty years usurped by the Turks,—a crying
shame and loss for Christendom. Now in this isle, as I
am informed of sundry Genoese traders, ’tis the custom
that every woman desiring to continue a widow, without
any intent to marry again, is constrained to pay to the
Seigneurie of the island a certain fixed sum of money,
which they call <i>argomoniatiquo</i>, which is the same as saying
(with all respect to the ladies), <i>an idle spot is useless</i>.
So likewise at Sparta, as Plutarch saith in his <i>Life of
Lysander</i>, was a fine established by law against such as
would not marry, or did marry over late, or ill. To return
to Scio (Chios), I have enquired of certain natives
of that island, what might be the aim and object of the
said custom, which told me ’twas to the end the isle might
always be well peopled. I can vouch for this, that our
land of France will surely never be left desert or infertile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
by fault of our widows’ not marrying again; for I ween
there be more which do re-marry than not, and will pay
never a doit of tribute for idle and useless females. And
if not by marriage, at any rate in other ways, these
Chiotes do make that same organ work and fructify, as
I will presently show. ’Tis well too for our maids of
France they need not to pay the tax their sisters of Chios
be liable to; for these, whether in country or town, if
they do come to lose their maidenhead before marriage,
and be fain after to continue the trade, be bound to pay
once for all a ducat (and surely ’tis a good bargain to
compound for all their life after at this price) to the
Captain of the Night Watch, so as they may pursue their
business as they please, without let or hindrance. And
herein doth lie the chiefest and most certain profit this
worthy Captain doth come by in his office.</p>

<p>These dames and damsels of this Isle be much different
from those of olden days in the same land, which, by
what Plutarch saith in his <i>Opuscula</i>, were so chaste for
seven hundred years, that never a case was remembered
where a married woman had done adultery, or a maid
had been deflowered unwed. A miracle! ’twill be said, a
mythic tale worthy of old Homer! At any rate be sure
they be much other nowadays!</p>

<p>Never was a time when the Greeks had not always some
device or other making for wantonness. So in old times
we read of a custom in the isle of Cyprus, which ’tis said
the kindly goddess Venus, the patroness of that land, did
introduce. This was that the maids of that island should
go forth and wander along the banks, shores and cliffs
of the sea, for to earn their marriage portions by the
generous giving of their bodies to mariners, sailors and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
seafarers along that coast. These would put in to shore
on purpose, very often indeed turning aside from their
straight course by compass to land there; and so taking
their pleasant refreshment with them, would pay handsomely,
and presently hie them away again to sea, for
their part only too sorry to leave such good entertainment
behind. Thus would these fair maids win their
marriage dowers, some more, some less, some high, some
low, some grand, some lowly, according to the beauty,
gifts and carnal attractions of each damsel.</p>

<p>Nowadays ’tis different. No maids in any Christian
nation do thus go wandering forth, to expose them to
wind and rain, cold and heat, sun and moon, and so win
their dower, for that the task is too laborious for their
delicate and tender skins and white complexions. Rather
do they have their lovers come to them under rich pavilions
and gorgeous hangings, and do there draw their
amorous profit from their paramours, without ever a
tax to pay. I speak not now of the courtesans of Rome,
who do pay tax, but of women of higher place than
they. In fact for the most part for such damsels their
fathers, mothers and brothers, be not at much pains to
gather money for their portion on marriage; but on the
contrary many of them be found able to give handsomely
to their kinsfolk, and advance the same in goods and
offices, ranks and dignities, as myself have seen in many
instances.</p>

<p>For this cause did Lycurgus ordain in his Laws that
virgins should be wedded without money dowry, to the
end men might marry them for their merits, and not from
greed. But, what kind of virtue was it? Why! on their
solemn feast-days the Spartan maids were used to sing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
and dance in public stark naked with the lads, and even
wrestle in the open market-place,—the which however was
done in all honesty and good faith, so History saith. But
what sort of honesty and purity was this, we may well
ask, to look on at these pretty maids so performing publicly?
Honesty was it never a whit, but pleasure in the
sight of them, and especially of their bodily movements
and dancing postures, and above all in their wrestling;
and chiefest of all when they came to fall one atop of the
other, as they say in Latin, <i>illa sub, ille super</i>; <i>ille sub et
illa super</i>,—“she underneath, he atop; he underneath, she
atop.” You will never persuade me, ’twas all honesty
and purity herein with these Spartan maidens. I ween
there is never chastity so chaste that would not have been
shaken thereby, or that, so making in public and by day
these feint assaults, they did not presently in privity and
by night and on assignation proceed to greater combats
and night-attacks. And no doubt all this might well be
done, seeing how the said Lycurgus did suffer such men
as were handsome and well grown to borrow other citizens’
wives to sow seed therein as in a good and fruitful
soil. So was it in no wise blameworthy for an old outwearied
husband to lend his young and beautiful wife to
some gallant youth he did choose therefor. Nay! the
lawgiver did pronounce it permissible for the wife herself
to choose for to help her procreation the next kinsman
of her husband, then an if he pleased her fancy, to
couple with him, to the end the children they might engender
should at least be of the blood and race of the
husband. Indeed there is some sense in the practice, and
had not the Jews likewise the same law of license betwixt
sister-in-law and brother-in-law? On the other hand our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
Christian law hath reformed all this, albeit our Holy
Father hath in divers cases granted dispensations founded
on divers reasons. In Spain ’tis a practice much adopted,
but never without dispensation.</p>

<p>Well! to say something more, and as soberly as we may,
of some other sorts of widows,—and then an end.</p>

<p>One sort there is, widows which do absolutely refuse
to marry again, hating wedlock like the plague. So one,
a lady of a great house and a witty woman withal, when
that I asked her if she were not minded to make her vow
once again to the god Hymen, did reply: “Tell me this,
by’r lady; suppose a galley-slave or captive to have tugged
years long at the oar, tied to the chain, and at last
to have got back his freedom, would he not be a fool and
a very imbecile, an if he did not hie him away with a good
heart, determined never more to be subject to the orders
of a savage corsair? So I, after being in slavery to an
husband, an if I should take a fresh master, what should
I deserve to get, prithee, since without resorting to that
extreme, and with no risk at all, I can have the best of
good times?” Another great lady, and a kinswoman of
mine own, on my asking her if she had no wish to wed
again, replied: “Never a bit, coz, but only to bed again,”
playing on the words <i>wed</i> and <i>bed</i>, and signifying she
would be glad enough to give herself some treat, but
without intervention of any second husband,—according
to the old proverb which saith, “A safer fling unwed than
wed.” Another saying hath it, that women be always
good hostesses, in love as elsewhere; and a right saying
’tis, for they be mistresses of the situation, and queens
wherever they be,—that is the pretty ones be so.</p>

<p>I have heard tell of another, which was asked of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
gentleman which was fain to try his ground as a suitor
for her hand, an if she would not like an husband. “Nay!
sir,” she answered, “never talk to me of an husband, I’ll
have no more of them; but for a lover, I’m not so sure.”—“Then,
Madame, prithee, let me be that lover, since husband
I may not be.” Her reply was, “Court me well,
and persevere; mayhap you will succeed.”</p>

<p>A fair and honourable widow lady, of some thirty summers,
one day wishing to break a jest with an honourable
gentleman, or to tell truth, to provoke him to love-making,
and having as she was about to mount her horse caught
the front of her mantle on something and torn it somewhat
in detaching it, taking it up said to him: “Look
you, what you have done, so and so” (accosting him by
his name); “you have ripped my front.”</p>

<p>“I should be right sorry to hurt it, Madam; ’tis too
sweet and pretty for that.”</p>

<p>“Why! what know you of it?” she replied; “you have
never seen it.”</p>

<p>“What! can you deny,” retorted the other, “that I
have seen it an hundred times over, when you were a little
lassie?”</p>

<p>“Ah! but,” said she, “I was then but a stripling, and
knew not yet what was what.”</p>

<p>“Still, I suppose ’tis yet in the same place as of old,
and hath not changed position. I ween I could even now
find it in the same spot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! ’tis there still, albeit mine husband hath
rolled it and turned it about, more than ever did Diogenes
with his tub.”</p>

<p>“Yes! and nowadays how doth it do without movement?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span></p>

<p>“’Tis for all the world like a clock that is left unwound.”</p>

<p>“Then take you heed, lest that befall you that doth
happen to clocks when they be not wound up, and continue
so for long; their springs do rust by lapse of time, and
they be good for naught after.”</p>

<p>“’Tis not a fair comparison,” said she, “for that the
springs of the clock you mean be not liable to rust at
all, but keep in good order, wound or unwound, always
ready to be set a-going at any time.”</p>

<p>“Please God,” cried the gentleman, “whenas the time
for winding come, I might be the watchmaker to wind it
up!”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” returned the lady, “when that day and
festive hour shall arrive, we will not be idle, but will do
a right good day’s work. So God guard from ill him I
love not as well as you.”</p>

<p>After this keen and heart pricking interchange of wit,
the lady did mount her horse, after kissing the gentleman
with much good-will, adding as she rode away, “Goodbye,
till we meet again, and enjoy our little treat!”</p>

<p>But alas! as ill fate would have it, the fair lady did
die within six weeks whereat her lover did well nigh die of
chagrin. For these enticing words, with others she had
said afore, had so heartened him with good hope that he
was assured of her conquest, as indeed she was ready
enough to be his. A malison on her untimely end, for
verily she was one of the best and fairest dames you could
see anywhere, and well worth a venial fault to possess,—or
even a mortal sin!</p>

<p>Another fair young widow was asked by an honourable
gentleman if she did keep Lent, and abstain from eating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
meat, as folks do then. “No!” she said, “I do not.”—“So
I have observed,” returned the gentleman; “I have noted
you made no scruple, but did eat meat at that season
just as at any other, both raw and cooked.”—“That was
at the time mine husband was alive; now I am a widow,
I have reformed and regulated my living more seemly.”—“Nay!
beware,” then said the other, “of fasting so strictly,
for it doth readily happen to such as go fasting and anhungered,
that anon, when the desire of meat cometh on
them, they do find their vessels so narrow and contracted,
as that they do thereby suffer much incommodity.”—“Nay!
that vessel of my body,” said the lady, “that you
mean, is by no means so narrow or hunger-pinched, but
that, when mine appetite shall revive, I may not afford
it good and sufficient refreshment.”</p>

<p>I knew another great lady, which all through her unmarried
and married life was in all men’s mouths by
reason of her exceeding stoutness. Afterward she came
to lose her husband, and did mourn him with so extreme
a sorrow that she grew as dry as
<span class="no-wrap">wood.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span>
Yet did she
never cease to indulge her in the joys of former days,
even going so far as to borrow the aid of a certain Secretary
she had, and of other such to boot, and even of her
cook, so ’twas reported. For all that, she did not win
back her flesh, albeit the said cook, who was all fat and
greasy, ought surely, I ween, to have made her fat. So
she went on, taking now one, now another of her serving-men,
all the while playing the part of the most prudish
and virtuous dame in all the Court, with pious phrases
ever on her lips, and naught but scandal against all other
women, and never a word of good for any of them. Of
like sort was that noble woman of Dauphiné, in the <i>Cent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
Nouvelles</i> of the Queen of Navarre, which was found lying
flat on the grass with her groom or muleteer by a certain
gentleman, that was ready to die of love for her but this
sight did quick cure his love sickness for him.</p>

<p>I have heard speak of a very beautiful woman at
Naples, which had the repute of going in like manner
with a Moor, the ugliest fellow in the world, who was
her slave and groom, but something made her love him.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">12.</p>

<p>I have read in an old Romance, <i>Jehan de
Saintré</i>, printed in black letter, how the late
King John of France did rear the hero Jehan
as his page. Now by custom of former days,
great folk were used to send their pages to carry messages,
as is done likewise to-day. But then they were
wont to go everywhere, and up and down the countryside,
a-horseback; I have even heard our fathers say
they were not seldom sent on minor embassies, for by
despatching a page and horse and a broad piece, the
thing was done and so much expense well spared. This
same little Jehan de Saintré (for so he did long continue
to be
<span class="no-wrap">called)<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129*]</a></span>
was very much loved of his master the King,
for that he was full of wit and intelligence, and was often
sent to carry trifling messages to his sister, who was
at the time a widow,—though the book saith not whose
widow. This great lady did fall enamoured of the lad,
after he had been several times on errands to her; so one
day, finding a good opportunity and no one nigh, she did
question him, asking him an if he did not love some lady
or other at Court, and which of them all liked him best.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
This is a way a great many ladies have, whenas they be
fain to score the first point and deliver their first attack
on one they fancy, as myself have seen done. Well! little
Jehan de Saintré, who had never so much as dreamed of
love, told her, “No! not yet,” going on to describe several
Court ladies, and what he thought of them. Then did
she hold forth to him on the beauties and delights of
love, but he only answered, “Nay! I care less than ever
for’t.” For in those old days, even as to-day, some of
our greatest ladies were slaves to love and much subject
to detraction; for indeed folk so adroit as they have
grown since, and ’twas only the cleverest that had the
good fortune to impose on their husbands and pass as
good women by virtue of their hypocrisies and little
wiles. The lady then, seeing the lad to be well-favoured,
goes on to tell him how she would give him a mistress
that would love him well, provided he was a true lover to
her, making him promise under pain of instant shame
and disgrace, that above all he should be sure and secret.
Eventually she did make her avowal to him, and tell him
herself would fain be his lady and darling,—for in those
days the word <i>mistress</i> was not as yet in vogue. At this
the young page was sore astonished, thinking she did but
make a mock of him, or wished to trap him and get him
a whipping.</p>

<p>However she did very soon show so many unequivocal
signs of fire and heat of love and such tender familiarities,
as that he perceived ’twas no mockery; while she kept
on telling him she would train and form him and make
him a great man. The end was their loves and mutual
joys did last a long while, during his pagehood and after
he was no more a page, till at the last he had to depart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
on a distant journey,—when she did change him for a
great, fat Abbé. This is the tale we find in the <i>Nouvelles
du monde advantureux</i>, writ by a gentleman of the chamber
to the Queen of Navarre, wherein we see the Abbé
put an affront on the said Jehan de Saintré, that was so
brave and valiant; yet did he in no long while pay the
worthy Abbé back in good coin and three times over.
’Tis an excellent Tale, and cometh from the book I have
<span class="no-wrap">named.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130*]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we see how ’tis not only of to-day that fair ladies
do love pages, above all when they be gay and speckled
like partridges. And verily, what creatures women be!—that
be ready enough to have lovers galore, but husbands
not! This they do for the love of freedom, which is indeed
a noble thing. For they think, when once they be
out of their husband’s rule, they are in Paradise, having
their fine dower and spending it themselves, managing
all the household, and handling the coin. All goeth
through their hands; and instead of being servants, they
be now mistresses, and do make free choice of their
pleasures, and such as do best minister to the same.</p>

<p>Others again there be, which do surely hate the notion
of making a second marriage, from distaste to lose their
rank and dignity, their goods, riches and honours, their
soft and luxurious living, and for this cause do restrain
their passions. So have I known and heard speak of not
a few great dames and Princesses, which from mere dread
of their failing to find again the grandeurs of their first
match, and so losing rank, would never marry again.
Not that they did cease therefor one whit to follow after
love and turn the same to their joy and delight,—yet
all the while never losing their rank and dignity, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
stools of state and honourable seats in Queens’ chambers
and elsewhere. Lucky women, to enjoy their grandeur
and mount high, yet abase them low, at one and the
same time! But to say a word of reproach or remonstrance
to them, never dream no such thing! Else no
end would there be of anger and annoyance, denials and
protestations, contradiction and revenge.</p>

<p>I have heard a tale told of a widow lady, and indeed I
knew her myself, which had long enjoyed the love of an
honourable gentleman, under pretext she would marry
him; but he did in no wise make himself obtrusive. A
great Princess, the lady’s mistress, was for reproaching
her for her conduct. But she, wily and corrupt, did
answer her: “Nay! Madam, but should it be denied us
to love with an honourable love? surely that were too
cruel.” Only God knoweth, this love she called honourable,
was really a most lecherous passion. And verily all
loves be so; they be born all pure, chaste and honourable,
but anon do lose their maidenhead, so to speak, and by
magic influence of some philosopher’s stone, be transformed
into base metal, and grow dishonourable and
lecherous.</p>

<p>The late M. de Bussy, who was one of the wittiest
talkers of his time, and no less pleasing as a story-teller,
one day at Court seeing a great lady, a widow, and of
ripe years, who did still persist in her amorous doings,
did exclaim: “What! doth this hackney yet frequent the
stallion?” The word was repeated to the lady, which
did vow mortal hate against the offender. On M. de
Bussy’s learning this, “Well, well!” he said, “I know how
to make my peace, and put this all right. Prithee, go
tell her I said not so, but that this is what I really said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
‘Doth this
<span class="no-wrap"><i>filly</i><a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span>
yet go to be mounted? For sure I am
she is not wroth because I take her for a light o’ love,
but for an old woman; and when she hears I called her
filly, that is to say a young mare, she will suppose I do
still esteem her a young woman.’” And so it was; for the
lady, on hearing this change and improvement in the
wording, did relax her anger and made it up with M.
de Bussy; whereat we did all have a good laugh. Yet for
all she might do, she was always deemed an old, half-foundered
jade, that aged as she was, still went whinnying
after the male.</p>

<p>This last was quite unlike another lady I have also
heard tell of, who having been a merry wench in her
earlier days, but getting well on in years, did set her to
serve God with fast and prayer. An honourable gentleman
remonstrating and asking her wherefore she did
make such long vigils at Church and such severe fasts
at table, and if it were not to vanquish and deaden the
stings of the flesh, “Alas!” said she, “these be all over
and done with for me.” These words she did pronounce
as piteously as ever spake Milo of Croton, that strong
and stalwart wrestler of old, (I have told the tale elsewhere,
methinks), who having one day gone down into
the arena, or wrestlers’ ring, but only for to view the
game, for he was now grown very old, one of the band
coming up to him did ask, an if he would not try yet a
fall of the old sort. But he, baring his arms and right
sadly turning back his sleeves, said only, gazing the
while at his muscles and sinews: “Alas! they be dead
now.”</p>

<p>Another like incident did happen to a gentleman I
wot of, similar to the tale I have just told of M. de Bussy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
Coming to Court, after an absence of six months, he
there beheld a lady which was used to attend the academy,
lately introduced at Court by the late King. “Why!”
saith he, “doth the academy then still exist? I was told
it had been abolished.”—“Can you doubt,” a courtier
answered him, “her attendance? Why! her master is
teaching her philosophy, which doth speak and treat of
perpetual motion.” And in good sooth, for all the beating
of brains these same philosophers do undergo, to
discover perpetual motion, yet is there none more surely
so than the motion Venus doth teach in <i>her</i> school.</p>

<p>A lady of the great world did give even a better answer
of another, whose beauty they were extolling highly, only
that her eyes did ever remain motionless, she never turning
the same one way or the other. “We must suppose,”
she said, “all her care doth go to move other portions
of her body, and so hath she none to spare for her
eyes.”</p>

<p>However, an if I would put down in writing all the
witty words and good stories I know, to fill out my matter,
I should never get me done. And so, seeing I have
other subjects to attack, I will desist, and finish with this
saying of Boccaccio, already cited above, namely, that
women, maids, wives and widows alike, at least the most
part of them, be one and all inclined to love. I have no
thought to speak of common folk, whether in country
or in town, for such was never mine intention in writing,
but only of well-born persons, in whose service my pen
is aye ready to run nimbly. But for mine own part, if I
were asked my true opinion, I should say emphatically
there is naught like married women, all risk and peril on
their husbands’ side apart, for to win good enjoyment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
of love withal, and to taste quick the very essence of its
delights. The fact is their husbands do heat them so,
they be like a furnace, continually poked and stirred, that
asks naught but fuel, water and wood or charcoal to
keep up its heat for ever. And truly he that would have
a good light, must always be putting more oil in the lamp.
At the same time let him beware of a foul stroke, and
those ambushes of jealous husbands wherein the wiliest
be oft times
<span class="no-wrap">caught!<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132*]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet is a man bound to go as circumspectly as he may,
and as boldly to boot, and do like the great King Henri,
who was much devoted to love, but at the same time
exceeding respectful toward ladies, and discreet, and for
these reasons much loved and well received of them. Now
whenever it fell out that this monarch was changing night
quarters and going to sleep in the bed of a new mistress,
which expecting him, he would never go thither (as I
learn on very good authority) but by the secret galleries
of Saint-Germain, Blois or Fontainebleau, and the little
stealthy back-stairs, recesses and garrets of his castles.
First went his favourite valet of the chamber, Griffon
by name, which did carry his boar-spear before him along
with the torch, and the King next, his great cloak held
before his face or else his night-gown, and his sword
under his arm. Presently, being to bed with the lady,
he would aye have his spear and sword put by the bed’s-head,
the door well shut, and Griffon guarding it, watching
and sleeping by turns. Now I leave it to you, an if a
great King did give such heed to his safety (for indeed
there have been some caught, both kings and great
princes,—for instance the Duc de Fleurance Alexandre
in our day), what smaller folks should do, following the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
example of this powerful monarch. Yet there are to be
found proud souls which do disdain all precaution; and
of a truth they be often trapped for their pains.</p>

<p>I have heard a tale related of King Francis, how having
a fair lady as
<span class="no-wrap">mistress,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133*]</a></span>
a connection that had long
subsisted betwixt them, and going one day unexpectedly
to see the said lady, and to sleep with her at an unusual
hour, ’gan knock loudly on the door, as he had both
right and might to do, being the master. She, who was at
the moment in company of the Sieur de Bonnivet, durst
not give the reply usual with the Roman courtesans under
like circumstances, <i>Non si puo, la signora è accompagnata</i>,—“You
cannot come in; Madam has company with
her.” In this case the only thing to do was to devise
quick where her gallant could be most securely hid. By
good luck ’twas summer time, so they had put an heap of
branches and leaves in the fire-place, as the custom is in
France. Accordingly she did counsel and advise him to
make at once for the fire-place, and there hide him among
the leafage, all in his shirt as he was,—and ’twas a fortunate
thing for him it was not winter. After the King
had done his business with the lady, he was fain to make
water; so getting up from the bed, he went to the fire-place
to do so, for lack of other convenience. And so
sore did he want to, that he did drown the poor lover
worse than if a bucket of water had been emptied over
him, for he did water him thoroughly, as with a garden
watering-pot, all round and about, and even over the
face, eyes, nose, mouth and everywhere; albeit by tight
shut lips he may have escaped all but a drop or so in his
chops. I leave you to fancy what a sorry state the
poor gentleman was in, for he durst not move, and what a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
picture of patience and grim endurance he did present!
The King having done, withdrew, and bidding his mistress
farewell, left the chamber. The lady had the door immediately
shut behind him, and calling her lover into
her, did warm the poor man, giving him a clean shift to
put on. Nor was it without some fun and laughter, after
the fright they had had; for an if he had been discovered,
both he and she had been in very serious peril.</p>

<p>’Twas the same lady, which being deep in love with
this M. de Bonnivet, and desiring to convince the King
of the contrary, for that he had conceived some touch of
jealousy on the subject, would say thus to him: “Oh! but
he’s diverting, that Sieur de Bonnivet, who thinks himself
so handsome! and the more I tell him he is a pretty
fellow, the more he doth believe it. ’Tis my great pastime,
making fun of the man, for he’s really witty and
ready-tongued, and no one can help laughing in his company,
such clever retorts doth he make.” By these words
she was for persuading the King that her common discourse
with Bonnivet had naught to do with love and
alliance, or playing his Majesty false in any wise. How
many fair dames there be which do practise the like wiles,
and to cloak the intrigues they are pursuing with some
lover, do speak ill of him, and make fun of him before
the world, though in private they soon drop this fine
pretense; and this is what they call cunning and contrivance
in love.</p>

<p>I knew a very great
<span class="no-wrap">lady,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134*]</a></span>
who one day seeing her
daughter, which was one of the fairest of women, grieving
for the love of a certain gentleman, with whom her
brother was sore angered, did say this to her amongst
other things: “Nay! my child, never love that man. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
manners and form be so bad, and he’s such an ugly
fellow. He’s for all the world like a village pastry cook!”
At this the daughter burst out a-laughing, making merry
at his expense and applauding her mother’s description,
allowing his likeness to a pastry-cook, red cap and all.
For all that, she had her way; but some while after, in
another six months that is, she did leave him for another
man.</p>

<p>I have known not a few ladies which had no words
bad enough to cast at women that loved inferiors,—their
secretaries, serving-men and the like low-born persons,
declaring publicly they did loathe such intrigues worse
than poison. Yet would these very same ladies be giving
themselves up to these base pleasures as much as any.
Such be the cunning ways of women; before the world
they do show fierce indignation against these offenders,
and do threaten and abuse them; but all the while behind
backs they do readily enough indulge the same vice themselves.
So full of wiles are they! for as the Spanish
proverb saith, <i>Mucho sabe la zorra; mas sabe mas la
dama enamorada</i>,—“The fox knoweth much, but a woman
in love knoweth more.”</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center bold p2">13.</p>

<p>However, for all this fair lady of the tale
told above did to lull King Francis’ anxiety,
yet did she not drive forth every grain of
suspicion from out his head, as I have reason
to know. I do remember me how once, making a visit
to Chambord to see the castle, an old porter that was
there, who had been body servant to King Francis, did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
receive me very obligingly. For in his earlier days he
had known some of my people both at Court and in the
field, and was of his own wish anxious to show me everything.
So having led me to the King’s bed-chamber, he
did show me a phrase of writing by the side of the window
on the left hand. “Look, Sir!” he cried, “read yonder
words. If you have never seen the hand-writing of the
King, mine old master, there it is.” And reading it, we
found this phrase, “<i>Toute femme varie</i>,” writ there in
large letters. I had with me a very honourable and very
able gentleman of Périgord, my friend, by name M. des
Roches, to whom I turned and said quickly: “’Tis to be
supposed, some of the ladies he did love best, and of
whose fidelity he was most assured, had been found of him
to <i>vary</i> and play him false. Doubtless he had discovered
some change in them that was scarce to his liking, and
so, in despite, did write these words.” The porter overhearing
us, put in: “Why! surely, surely! make no mistake,
for of all the fair dames I have seen and known,
never a one but did cry off on a false scent worse than
ever his hunting pack did in chasing the stag; yet ’twas
with a very subdued voice, for an if he had noted it,
he would have brought ’em to the scent again pretty
smartly.”</p>

<p>They were, ’twould seem, of those women, which can
never be content with either their husbands or their
lovers, Kings though they be, and Princes and great
Lords; but must be ever chopping and changing. Such
this good King had found them by experience to be,
having himself first debauched the same and taken them
from the charge of their husbands or their mothers,
tempting them from their maiden or widowed estate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span></p>

<p>I have both known and heard speak of a
<span class="no-wrap">lady,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135*]</a></span>
so fondly
loved of her Prince, as that for the mighty affection he
bare her, he did plunge her to the neck in all sorts of
favours, benefits and honours, and never another woman
was to be compared with her for good fortune. Natheless
was she so enamoured of a certain Lord, she would never
quit him. Then whenas he would remonstrate and declare
to her how the Prince would ruin both of them,
“Nay! ’tis all one,” she would answer; “an if you leave
me, I shall ruin myself, for to ruin you along with me.
I had rather be called your concubine than this Prince’s
mistress.” Here you have woman’s caprice surely, and
wanton naughtiness to boot! Another very great lady
I have known, a widow, did much the same; for albeit
she was all but adored of a very great nobleman, yet
must she needs have sundry other humbler lovers, so as
never to lose an hour of her time or ever be idle. For
indeed one man only cannot be always at work and afford
enough in these matters; and the rule of love is this, that
a passionate woman is not for one stated time, nor yet
for one stated person alone, nor will confine her to one
passion,—reminding me of that dame in the <i>Cent Nouvelles</i>
of the Queen of Navarre, which had three lovers
all at once, and was so clever she did contrive to manage
them all three most adroitly.</p>

<p>The beautiful Agnes Sorel, the adored mistress of King
Charles VII., was suspected by him of having borne a
daughter that he thought not to be his, nor was he ever
able to recognize her. And indeed, like mother, like
daughter, was the word, as our Chroniclers do all agree.
The same again did Anne Boleyn, wife of King Henry
VIII. of England, whom he did behead for not being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
content with him, but giving herself to adultery. Yet
had he chose her for her beauty, and did adore her fondly.</p>

<p>I knew another lady which had been loved by a very
honourable gentleman, but after some while left by him;
and one day it happened that these twain fell to discussing
their former loves. The gentleman, who was for
posing as a dashing blade, cried, “Ha! ha! and think
you, you were my only mistress in those days? You will
be much surprised to hear, I had two others all the while,
would you not?” To this she answered on the instant,
“You would be yet more surprised, would you not? to
learn you were anything but mine only lover then, for I
had actually three beside you to fall back on.” Thus
you see how a good ship will always have two or three
anchors for to ensure its safety thoroughly.</p>

<p>To conclude,—love is all in all for women, and so it
should be! I will only add how once I found in the tablets
of a very fair and honourable lady which did stammer a
little Spanish, but did understand the same language well
enough, this little maxim writ with her own hand, for I
did recognize it quite easily: <i>Hembra o dama sin compagnero,
esperanza sin trabajo, y navio sin timon; nunca
pueden hazer cost que sea buena</i>,—“Man or woman without
companion, hope without work, or ship without rudder,
will never do aught good for much.” ’Tis a saying
equally true for wife, widow and maid; neither one nor
the other can do aught good without the company of a
man, while the hope a lover hath of winning them is not
by itself near so like to gain them over readily as with
something of pains and hard work added, and some strife
and struggle. Yet doth not either wife or widow give
so much as a maid must, for ’tis allowed of all to be an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
easier and simpler thing to conquer and bring under one
that hath already been conquered, subdued and overthrown,
than one that hath never yet been vanquished,—and
that far less toil and pains is spent in travelling a
road already well worn and beaten than one that hath
never been made and traced out,—and for the truth
of these two instances I do refer me to travellers and men
of war. And so it is with maids; indeed there be even
some so capricious as that they have always refused to
marry, choosing rather to live ever in maidenly estate.
But an if you ask them the reason, “’Tis so, because my
humour is to have it so,” they declare. Cybelé, Juno,
Venus, Thetis, Ceres and other heavenly goddesses, did
all scorn this name of virgin,—excepting only Pallas,
which did spring from her father Jupiter’s brain, hereby
showing that virginity is naught but a notion conceived
in the brain. So, ask our maids, which will never marry,
or an if they do, do so as late as ever they can, and at
an over ripe age, why they marry not, “’Tis because I
do not wish,” they say; “such is my humour and my
notion.”</p>

<p>Several such we have seen at the Court of our Princes
in the days of King Francis. The Queen Regent had a
very fair and noble maid of honour, named
<span class="no-wrap">Poupincourt,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136*]</a></span>
which did never marry, but died a maid at the age of
sixty, as chaste as when she was born, for she was most
discreet. La Brelandière again died a maid and virgin at
the ripe age of eighty, the same which was governess of
Madame d’Angoulême as a girl.</p>

<p>I knew another maid of honour of very great and exalted
family, and at the time seventy years of age, which
would never marry,—albeit she was no wise averse to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
love without marriage. Some that would fain excuse her
for that she would not marry, used to aver she was meet
to be no husband’s wife, seeing she had no affair at all.
God knoweth the truth! but at any rate she did find a
good enough one to have good fun elsewhere withal. A
pretty excuse truly!</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Charansonnet, of Savoy, died at
Tours lately, a maid, and was interred with her hat and
her white virginal robe, very solemnly, with much pomp,
stateliness and good company, at the age of forty-five
or over. Nor must we doubt in her case, ’twas any defect
which stood in the way, for she was one of the fairest,
most honourable and most discreet ladies of the Court,
and myself have known her to refuse very excellent and
very high-born suitors.</p>

<p>Mine own sister, Mademoiselle de Bourdeille, which is
at Court maid of honour of the present Queen, hath in
like wise refused very excellent offers, and hath never
consented to marry, nor never will. So firm resolved is
she and obstinate to live and die a maid, no matter to
what age she may attain; and indeed so far she hath
kept steady to her purpose, and is already well advanced
in years.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de
<span class="no-wrap">Certan,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137*]</a></span>
another of the Queen’s maids
of honour, is of the same humour, as also Mademoiselle
de Surgières, the most learned lady of the Court, and
therefore known as <i>Minerva</i>,—and not a few others.</p>

<p>The Infanta of Portugal, daughter of the late Queen
Eleanor, I have seen of the same resolved mind; and she
did die a maid and virgin at the age of sixty or over.
This was sure from no want of high birth, for she was
well born in every way, nor of wealth, for she had plenty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
and above all in France, where General Gourgues did
manage her affairs to much advantage, nor yet of natural
gifts, for I did see her at Lisbon, at the age of five and
forty, a very handsome and charming woman, of good
and graceful appearance, gentle, agreeable, and well deserving
an husband her match in all things, in courtesy
and the qualities we French do most possess. I can affirm
this, from having had the honour of speaking with this
Princess often and familiarly.</p>

<p>The late Grand Prior of Lorraine, when he did bring
his galleys from East to West of the Mediterranean
Sea on his voyage to Scotland, in the time of the minority
of King Francis II., passing by Lisbon and tarrying
there some days, did visit and see her every day. She
did receive him most courteously and took great delight
in his company, loading him with fine presents. Amongst
others, she gave him a chain to suspend his cross withal,
all of diamonds and rubies and great pearls, well and
richly worked; and it might be worth from four to five
thousand crowns, going thrice round his neck. I think
it might well be worth that sum, for he could always
pawn it for three thousand crowns, as he did one time
in London, when we were on our way back from Scotland.
But no sooner was he returned to France than he did
send to get it out again, for he did love it for the sake of
the lady, with whom he was no little captivated and taken.
And I do believe she was no less fond of him, and would
willingly have unloosed her maiden knot for him,—that
is by way of marriage, for she was a most discreet and
virtuous Princess. I will say more, and that is, that
but for the early troubles that did arise in France, into
the which his brothers did draw him and kept him engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
therein, he would himself have brought his galleys back
and returned the same road, for to visit this Princess
again and speak of wedlock with her. And I ween he
would in that case have hardly been shown the door, for
he was of as good an house as she, and descended of great
Kings no less than she, and above all was one of the
handsomest, most agreeable, honourable and best Princes
of Christendom. Now for his brothers, in particular the
two eldest, for these were the oracles of the rest and
captains of the ship, I did one day behold them and him
conversing of the matter, the Cardinal telling them of his
voyage and the pleasures and favours he had received at
Lisbon. They were much in favour of his making the
voyage once more and going back thither again, advising
him to pursue his advantage in that quarter, as the Pope
would at once have given him dispensation of his religious
orders. And but for those accursed troubles I have spoke
of, he would have gone, and in mine opinion the emprise
had turned out to his honour and satisfaction. The said
Princess did like him well, and spake to me of him very
fondly, asking me as to his death,—quite like a woman
in love, a thing easily enough perceived in such circumstances
by a man of a little penetration.</p>

<p>I have heard yet another reason alleged by a very
clever person, I say not whether maid or wife,—and she
had mayhap had experience of the truth thereof,—why
some women be so slow to marry. They declare this
tardiness cometh <i>propter mollitiem</i>, “by reason of luxuriousness.”
Now this word <i>mollities</i> doth mean, they be
so luxurious, that is to say so much lovers of their own
selves and so careful to have tender delight and pleasure
by themselves and in themselves, or mayhap with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
bosom friends, after the Lesbian fashion, and do find such
gratification in female society alone, as that they be convinced
and firmly persuaded that with men they would
never win such satisfaction. Wherefore they be content
to go without these altogether in their joys and toothsome
pleasures, without ever a thought of masculine
acquaintance or marriage.</p>

<p>Maids and virgins would seem in old days at Rome
to have been highly honoured and privileged, so much
so that the law had no jurisdiction over them to sentence
them to death. Hence the story we read of a Roman
Senator in the time of the Triumvirate, which was condemned
to die among other victims of the Proscription,
and not he alone, but all the offspring of his loins. So
when a daughter of his house did appear on the scaffold,
a very fair and lovely girl, but of unripe years and yet
virgin, ’twas needful for the executioner to deflower her
himself and take her maidenhead on the scaffold, and
only then when she was so polluted, could he ply his
knife upon her. The Emperor Tiberius did delight in
having fair virgins thus publicly deflowered, and then put
to death,—a right villainous piece of cruelty, pardy!</p>

<p>The Vestal Virgins in like manner were greatly honoured
and respected, no less for their virginity than for
their religious character; for indeed, an if they did show
any the smallest frailty of bodily purity, they were an
hundred times more rigorously punished than when they
had failed to take good heed of the sacred fire, and were
buried alive under the most pitiful and terrible circumstances.
’Tis writ of one Albinus, a Roman gentleman,
that having met outside Rome some Vestals that were
going somewhither a-foot, he did command his wife and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
children to descend from her chariot, to set them in it and
so complete their journey. Moreover they had such
weight and authority, as that very often they were trusted
as umpires to make peace betwixt the Roman people and
the Knights, when troubles did sometimes arise affecting
the two orders. The Emperor Theodosius did expel them
from Rome under advice of the Christians; but in opposition
to the said Emperor the Romans did presently depute
one Symmachus, to beseech him to restore them
again, with all their wealth, incomings and privileges as
before. These were exceedingly great, and indeed every
day they were used to distribute so great a store of alms,
as that neither native Roman nor stranger, coming or
going, was ever suffered to ask an alms, so copious was
their pious charity toward all poor folk. Yet would Theodosius
never agree to bring them back again.</p>

<p>They were named Vestals from the Latin word <i>vesta</i>,
signifying fire, the which may well turn and twist, shoot
and sparkle, yet doth it never cast seed, nor receive the
same,—and so ’tis with a virgin. They were bound so to
remain virgins for thirty years, after which they might
marry; but few of them were fortunate in so leaving their
first estate, just like our own nuns which have cast off
the veil and quitted the religious habit. They kept much
state and went very sumptuously dressed,—of all which
the poet Prudentius doth give a pleasing description,
being apparently much in the condition of our present
Lady Canonesses of Mons in Hainault and Réaumond in
Lorraine, which be permitted to marry after. Moreover
this same Prudentius doth greatly blame them because
they were used to go abroad in the city in most magnificent
coaches, correspondingly attired, and to the Amphitheatres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
to see the games of the Gladiators and combats
to the death betwixt men and men, and men and wild
beasts, as though finding much delight in seeing folk thus
kill each other and shed blood. Wherefore he doth pray
the Emperor to abolish these sanguinary contests and
pitiful spectacles altogether. The Vestals at any rate
should never behold suchlike barbarous sports; though
indeed they might say for their part: “For lack of other
more agreeable sports, the which other women do see and
practise, we must needs content us with these.”</p>

<p>As for the estate of widows in many cases, there be
many which do love just as soberly as these Vestals, and
myself have known several such; but others again would
far fainer take their joy in secret with men, and in the
fullness of complete liberty, rather than subject to them
in the bonds of marriage. For this reason, when we do see
women long preserve their widowhood, ’tis best not over
much to praise them as we might be inclined to do, till
we do know their mode of life, and then only, according
to what we have learned thereof, either to extol them
most highly or scorn them. For a woman, when she is
fain to unbend her severity, as the phrase is, is terribly
wily, and will bring her man to a pretty market, an if he
take not good heed. And being so full of guile, she doth
well understand how to bewitch and bedazzle the eyes and
wits of men in such wise they can scarce possibly recognize
the real life they lead. For such or such an one they
will mistake for a perfect prude and model of virtue,
which all the while is a downright harlot, but doth play
her game so cunningly and furtively none can ever discover
aught.</p>

<p>I have known a great Lady in my time, which did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
remain a widow more than forty years, so acting all the
while as to be esteemed the most respectable woman in
country or Court, yet was she <i>sotto coverto</i> (under the
rose) a regular, downright harlot. So featly had she
followed the trade by the space of five and fifty years,
as maid, wife and widow, that scarce a suspicion had she
roused against her at the age of seventy, when she died.
She did get full value of her privileges as a woman; one
time, when a young widow, she fell in love with a certain
young nobleman, and not able otherwise to get him, she
did come one Holy Innocents’ day into his bed-chamber,
to give him the usual greetings. But the young man gave
her these readily enough, and with something else than
the customary instrument. She had her dose,—and many
another like it
<span class="no-wrap">afterward.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138*]</a></span></p>

<p>Another widow I have known, which did keep her widowed
estate for fifty years, all the while wantoning it
right gallantly, but always with the most prudish modesty
of mien, and many lovers at divers times. At the
last, coming to die, one she had loved for twelve long
years, and had had a son of him in secret, of this man
she did make so small account she disowned him completely.
Is not this a case where my word is illustrated,
that we should never commend widows over much, unless
we know thoroughly their life and life’s end?</p>

<p>But at this rate I should never end; and an end we
must have. I am well aware sundry will tell me I have
left out many a witty word and merry tale which might
have still better embellished and ennobled this my subject.
I do well believe it; but an if I had gone on so from
now to the end of the world, I should never have made
an end; however if any be willing to take the trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
to do better, I shall be under great obligation to the
same.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well! dear ladies, I must e’en draw to an end; and I
do beg you pardon me, an if I have said aught to offend
you. ’Tis very far from my nature, whether inborn or
gotten by education, to offend or displeasure you in
any wise. In what I say of women, I do speak of some,
not of all; and of these, I do use only false names and
garbled descriptions. I do keep their identity so carefully
hid, none may discover it, and never a breath of
scandal can come on them but by mere conjecture and
vague suspicion, never by certain inference.</p>

<p>I fear me ’tis only too likely I have here repeated a
second time sundry witty sayings and diverting tales I
have already told before in my other Discourses. Herein
I pray such as shall be so obliging as to read all my
works, to forgive me, seeing I make no pretence to being
a great Writer or to possess the retentive memory needful
to bear all in mind. The great Plutarch himself doth
in his divers Works repeat several matters twice over.
But truly, they that shall have the task of printing my
books, will only need a good corrector to set all this
matter right.</p>

<p class="hanging1">&#8195;She first visited the Court of France in the train of this latter
Princess in 1431, where she was known by the name of the <i>Demoiselle</i>
de Fromenteau, and at once captivated the young King’s heart.
She appeared at Paris in the Queen’s train in 1437, but was intensely
unpopular with the citizens, who attributed the wasteful expenditure
of the Court and the misfortunes of the Kingdom to her.
Whatever may be the truth of Brantôme’s tale of the astrologer,
there is no doubt as to her having exerted her influence to rouse
the King from the listless apathy he had fallen into, and the idle,
luxurious life he was leading in his Castle of Chinon, while the
English were still masters of half his dominions.</p>

where her tomb existed down to 1792.</p>

<p class="hanging1">◆Louis XI. is generally supposed not only to have bandied
many such stories with all the young bloods at the Court of Philippe
le Bon, Duke of Burgundy, where he had taken refuge when Dauphin,
but actually to have taken pains to have a collection of them made
and afterwards published in the same order in which we have them,
in the Work entitled “<i>Cent Nouvelles nouvelles</i>,” <i>lequel en soy contient
cent chapitres ou histoires, composées ou récitées par nouvelles
gens depuis naguères</i>,—“An Hundred New Romances,—a
Work containing in itself an hundred chapters or tales, composed
or recited by divers folk in these last years.” This is confirmed by
the words of the original preface or notice, which would appear to
have been written in his life-time: “And observe that throughout
the <i>Nouvelles</i>, wherever ’tis said by <i>Monseigneur</i>, Monseigneur the
Dauphin is meant, which hath since succeeded to the crown and is
now King Louis XI.; for in those days he was in the Duke of
Burgundy’s country.” But as it is absolutely certain this Prince
only withdrew into Brabant at the end of the year 1456, and only
returned to France in August 1461, it is quite impossible the Collection
can have appeared in France about the year 1455, as is
stated without sufficient consideration in the preface of the latest
editions of this work. Two ancient editions are known, one,—Paris
1486, folio; the other also published at Paris, by the widow
of Johan Treperre, N. D., also folio. Besides this, two modern

<p class="TN-style-1">The book contains long passages of older French in which the reader
will notice many flaws in grammar, spelling and accents. These may make
some of the French difficult to read but it will be obvious that this
cannot be fixed without sometimes inadvertently changing the intended
meaning. For that reason all passages in French are presented unchanged
in this transcription.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">Similarly with the passages in Italian and Spanish.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">For the rest of the text, the many inconsistencies in English spelling,
capitalisation, and hyphenation have been left unchanged except where
noted below. Other minor typographical errors have been corrected
without note.</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page xxviii – “or” changed to “of” (a contemporary of)</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 93 – “nay” changed to “any” (scarce any account of her)</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 126 – “may” changed to “many” (how many stages)</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 138 – “Fontainbleau” changed to “Fontainebleau” (at Fontainebleau)</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 259 – “Randam” changed to “Randan” (Madame de Randan)</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 290 – “Cnæus” changed to “Gnæus” (Gnæus Pompeius)</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p class="TN-style-1">The numbered references to endnotes on the pages of the book are
incorrect in most cases. Many other pages of the book should have
had references to endnotes but those references are missing.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">In order to reindex the references in this transcription, a temporary
‘placeholder’ reference was added to those pages where there should
have been at least one numbered reference to endnotes but it was
omitted in the book.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">The transcriber has retained these placeholder references as they are
helpful to the reader. Placeholder references are distinguished by an
asterisk next to the index number (as in [99*], for example). Their
role is exactly the same as that of the references originally present
in the book; namely to direct the reader to the correct page header in
the endnotes. Under that page header will be found all the author’s
notes relevant to the page.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">Where originally there were more than one numbered reference to
endnotes on a page of the book, these now have the same index number
in this transcription. That index number links to the respective page
header in the endnotes.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">Endnotes have been reformatted so that each separate note is
distinguished by a prefixing ◆ character.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
